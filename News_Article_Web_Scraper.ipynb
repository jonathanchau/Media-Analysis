[+] on December 22, 2023, ahead of the upcoming Christmas holiday. US airlines are gearing up for record traffic this holiday season, having beefed up staffing in the hopes of avoiding a repeat of last Christmas's operational meltdown. Authorities expect more than 267,000 flights between December 20 and 26, with a peak of nearly 49,000 flights on December 22, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) If you\\u2019re flying during the holiday season, knowing how the new U.S. Department of Transportation airline refund rule might apply is essential. This new rule ensures airlines compensate consumers fairly when air travel fails. However, it has some limitations. You should not assume your travel disruption will automatically qualify for a refund. You should also consider how accepting an airline\\u2019s alternative travel arrangements might impact your rights. HOUSTON, TEXAS - DECEMBER 21: Merrie Monzingo, left, dances with United Airlines employee Peaches ... [+] Sullivan as she gets ready to check in at the C Terminal at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Thursday, Dec. 21, 2023, in Houston. United expects more than 50,000 passengers, operating more than 400 flights a day through Houston, during the holiday season, a United spokesperson said. (Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) You will qualify for an automatic refund if an airline cancels your flight and does not rebook you on a new flight or offer compensation for the cancelation. That compensation can be a flight voucher for future travel or a loyalty reward credit such as points or miles. However, you will not get your money back for the trip once you accept that alternate compensation. You will also qualify for a refund if you do not accept the airline\\u2019s rebooking. You should consider whether the airline\\u2019s alternative travel plans are convenient and practical for you. Sometimes, you may be better off booking a new ticket with a different airline and getting your refund from the airline that canceled your original flight. While many airlines will offer passengers additional accommodations, such as hotel or meal vouchers and transportation, during service failures, you should ask for details before accepting the alternate itinerary. ORLANDO, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 22: Passengers are seen at the Frontier Airlines ticket ... [+] counter at Orlando International Airport ahead of the Christmas holiday travel on December 22, 2023 in Orlando, Florida. According to the travel organization AAA estimates 7.5 million people will travel by air, surpassing 2019's record of 7.3 million passengers. (Photo by Paul Hennesy/Anadolu via Getty Images) Along the same lines, you are entitled to a refund if the airline changes your original itinerary significantly, including the flight schedule, connections, destination or service. The U.S. DOT defines \\u201csignificant\\u201d changes as follows: The rule also applies when the airline downgrades your travel class. For example, if you paid for a first-class ticket and are asked to fly in economy class. This August, rapper Juvenile, whose legal name is Terius Gray, walked off an American Airlines flight after being downgraded. When the cabin crew on his New Orleans to Dallas flight informed him of the seat change, Gray took to social media to express his disappointment. His wife, who was traveling with him, retained her first-class seat. American Airlines explained that an aircraft change led to a shortage of first-class seats and prompted an automatic downgrade of randomly selected passengers. The angry rapper took a flight with a different airline. Delta Air Lines earned the displeasure of actor and K-pop star Hyeri last year for downgrading her first-class ticket to economy class on a U.S. domestic flight without issuing a refund. Delta explained the downgrade was also due to an aircraft change. However, with the new U.S. DOT rule, Juvenile and Hyeri would both qualify for an automatic refund and so would any passengers going through the same thing, celebrities or not. The U.S. DOT also considers the needs of disabled travelers. A change is significant if it includes connecting at different airports or flying on other aircraft that are \\u201cless accessible or accommodating\\u201d to a passenger\\u2019s disability. The airline may offer other compensation for any significant changes. However, once you accept that offer, you will not qualify for a refund. Los Angeles, CA -  Airliners taxi to their gates at LAX on Wednesday, Dec. 27, 2023. Travel experts ... [+] say this weekend will produce a surge in air passengers as people head home from their holiday trips.  (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) With the U.S. DOT\\u2019s new refund rule, you may be eligible to get back any additional services you paid for when booking your ticket under certain circumstances. For example, you can qualify for a refund of whatever you paid for checked baggage. You must file a mishandled baggage claim with the airline at the airport so there is a record of the service failure. If the airline fails to deliver your bags within 12 hours from when your plane was at the gate for a domestic flight and by 15-30 hours after your plane reached the gate for an international flight, you qualify for a baggage fee refund. The rule gives airlines more time to deliver luggage depending on how long the flight is, but 30 hours is the upper limit. If you paid for in-flight Wi-Fi but the service doesn\\u2019t work, you will also qualify for a service refund. If you paid for a specific seat and were asked to sit elsewhere, you qualify for a refund of the seat selection fee. You may also be eligible for a refund of any payment for in-flight entertainment if the service is unavailable. It\\u2019s important to understand that these ancillary refunds only apply when an airline charges you for the service. You are not due automatic compensation during the failure of any free Wi-Fi or in-flight entertainment included in your base fare. Also, these service failures do not obligate airlines to offer a full refund of the value of your ticket so long as the flight takes place according to the original booking. Jessica Chastain suffered social media backlash in October after failing to understand this limitation. The Oscar-winning actress contacted JetBlue on X, formerly Twitter, asking for a refund because the in-flight entertainment did not work during a six-hour flight. The airline offered the actress a $15.00 voucher for the inconvenience, but Chastain felt this wasn\\u2019t enough. \\u201cThank you @JetBlue for your $15.00 credit. My flight was $1,500 and the credit is 1/100 of the money I paid you,\\u201d Chastain posted. An airline representative on X expressed regret, but Chastain replied, \\u201cI understand but I spent $1500 on the flight and so did my husband. There should be some flight credit or something since I have a TrueBlue account and have been a loyal customer.\\u201d Whether or not you can relate to Chastain on this point, the reality is that airlines only make around $6.15 on average per passenger carried in profit, as reported by the International Air Transport Association. Everything else goes to cover the costs of getting you there. Still, travelers in the U.S. now have more rights when traveling by air.

That means that 15 years after he was released from federal prison for his involvement in a dogfighting ring and nine years after he played his last NFL game, Vick is writing the next chapter in what has become one of the greatest redemption arcs in American sports this century. Vick is writing the next chapter in what has become one of the greatest redemption arcs in American sports this century. Not everyone is on board, of course. The president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had something negative to say about Vick. He\\u2019ll never be forgiven by some people. Still, Norfolk State and Vick seem to need each other. And there may be no one more qualified to teach players how to move forward after making disastrous unforced errors. In his prime, Vick was a gift to football. As a quarterback, he possessed the speed of a track star, the evasiveness of an elite running back and a cannon for an arm. When the Falcons drafted him from Virginia Tech in 2001, Vick became the first Black quarterback to be taken with the top overall pick in an NFL draft. And he turned the Atlanta Falcons, a perennial NFL also-ran, into a team everybody wanted to watch. In 2006, he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season, a feat that wouldn\\u2019t be repeated until Lamar Jackson did it 13 years later. The 10-year, $138 million contract the Falcons gave him in 2004, was, at that point, the largest contract any NFL player had ever signed. At the same time, Vick was making a series of awful choices that made it apparent that he didn\\u2019t fully appreciate how good he had it. In 2007, when he was 27 and at or near the peak of his athletic ability, he pleaded guilty to his\\u00a0involvement in a dogfighting ring near his hometown of Newport News. That ring also included suspected drug dealers who were under federal investigation. The details of what went on at Bad Newz Kennels \\u2014 including the brutal executions of dogs that didn\\u2019t make the cut to fight competitively \\u2014 were the main source of anger at Vick, but there was also anger that someone whose athletic ability was unrivaled and who had earned so much money and fame threw it away. The black-and-red #7 Falcons jersey gave way to a federal inmate number at prisons in Virginia and Kansas where he served a total of 21 months. When Vick got out of prison, he played first for the Philadelphia Eagles, then the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Though his game was never the same as it had been with the Falcons, his off-field turnaround had already begun. He sought mentorship and received it from Tony Dungy, the first Black NFL head coach to win a Super Bowl and a notably religious man. Vick, who had been notoriously private, even with teammates, started to come out of his shell. He wrote and spoke publicly about his mistakes. He expressed contrition for his crimes and even gratitude for his growth behind bars. He spoke out against dogfighting even as animal rights protesters showed up at football stadiums to jeer him. For some people, that anger doesn\\u2019t appear to have dimmed. In a statement to Fox News this week, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk called Vick a \\u201ccharming, charismatic psychopath,\\u201d but she noted that at least she doesn\\u2019t believe he\\u2019ll fight dogs anymore. He sought mentorship and received it from Tony Dungy, the NFL\\u2019s first Black head coach to win a Super Bowl and a notably religious man. The Spartans have had one winning season this decade. They went 6-5 in 2021. Their 5-26 record since then means they\\u2019ve lost five times for every win. Norfolk State looks a lot like the program Jackson State University was before Deion \\u201cCoach Prime\\u201d Sanders took the helm of four years ago. Now Norfolk State is the HBCU turning to a former NFL legend hoping his coaching can drag its program into relevance. Sanders succeeded in turning Jackson State into a winner. Saturday, two years after Sanders left for Colorado, the JSU Tigers won the Celebration Bowl, considered the de facto HBCU football championship game. (The Tigers lost that game the two times they got that far during Sanders\\u2019 three seasons with the team.) It\\u2019s way too early to think about Vick leading Norfolk State to a Celebration Bowl, to broader relevance in the NCAA\\u2019s Football Championship Subdivision or even to a winning season. But he has a lot going for him: His fame (and notoriety) will certainly draw media attention to the school, and with him standing on the sidelines, making a recruiting pitch gets theoretically easier.\\u00a0In practice, Norfolk State will have to raise the kind of name, image and likeness money no HBCU has successfully put together yet to be successful. It\\u2019s possible, though, that Norfolk State is less interested in trying to compete with college football\\u2019s Power Five heavyweights and more interested in what Vick can teach its players about building character through adversity, about avoiding unforced errors in life and about rebuilding themselves, even after hitting rock bottom. If that\\u2019s the school\\u2019s goal, and if Vick can show that he knows how to teach something more important than X\\u2019s and O\\u2019s, then this gig just might work out.

Less than three years ago, Tina Willits, now 53, thought she had just two years to live. Today, she is cancer-free and wants the world to know about the treatment that saved her. The Florida mother and grandmother first felt a lump in late 2021, just months after a normal mammogram.\\u00a0 BREAST CANCER VACCINE UPDATE FROM CLEVELAND CLINIC: \\u2018A NEW ERA\\u2019 In March 2022, she discovered that she had HER2 positive breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease in which the cancer cells have an abnormally high level of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \\\"I still remember the doctor coming in and telling us that it was in my lymph nodes, ribs, spine, sternum and bones,\\\" Willits told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview. (See the video at the top of this article.)\\u00a0 Florida mother and grandmother Tina Willits, now 53, thought she had just two years to live, but today she is cancer-free. (Tina Willits) Willits was told that she had golf ball-sized tumors and that the disease was too advanced for a mastectomy. She was placed on end-of-care chemotherapy and told to \\\"enjoy the time you have left.\\\" \\\"The doctor told me, \\u2018We will try to stop the progression,\\u2019 but she said \\u2018the best we can probably offer you is about 24 months.\\u2019\\\" Willits wasn\\u2019t satisfied with just stopping the progression of her cancer. \\\"I have five biological children and I was raising two of my bonus babies, and I had four grandkids at the time,\\\" she said.\\u00a0 \\\"And I was just determined that I wanted it gone. That was my goal. And I remember my oncologist telling me that was never going to happen.\\\" \\\"The doctor told me, \\u2018The best we can offer you is about 24 months.\\u2019\\\" After doing some of her own research, Willits learned about an alternative treatment called immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.\\u00a0 For decades, the go-to\\u00a0treatments for cancer have been chemotherapy, radiation and surgery \\u2014 but some experts are calling immunotherapy the \\\"fourth pillar\\\" of cancer treatments. \\\"I have five biological children and I was raising two of my bonus babies, and I had four grandkids at the time,\\\" said Willits about why she was so determined to beat cancer. (Tina Willits) In her research, she came across Dr. Jason R. Williams of The Williams Cancer Institute in California, who offers a new cancer therapy that uses cold gases and the body's own cells to freeze and fight tumors.\\u00a0 \\\"Immunotherapy teaches the immune system to attack the cancer,\\\" Williams told Fox News Digital. \\\"So, like a vaccine, it can give you a long-term, durable response. This is what is needed to achieve cures.\\\" 4 HIDDEN SIGNS OF BREAST CANCER TO WATCH FOR: \\u2018YOU KNOW YOUR BODY\\u2019 Willits and her husband reached out to the doctor, who immediately began looking into her case. \\\"She physically was in good condition, even though her cancer was advanced,\\\" Williams said about Willits. \\\"She was on chemo, but still remained in very good health, even though she was advanced and metastatic.\\\" He added, \\\"I was confident, but cautious. Cancer is a very challenging foe.\\\" Willits is pictured at her wedding, before being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. \\\"I'm a part of my family\\u2019s life every day,\\\" she told Fox News Digital. (Tina Willits) Williams offered Willits something she hadn't had until then: hope. \\u00a0 \\\"He was just unbelievable. After seeing all of my tests, he said, \\u2018I can cure you,\\u2019\\\" she told Fox News Digital. \\\"And you don't get those words as a stage 4 patient.\\\" Six weeks after receiving a course of immunotherapy treatments \\u2014 in conjunction with supplements to ramp up the immune system and cryoablation, a procedure that uses freezing temperatures to destroy cancer cells \\u2014 a PET scan revealed that Willits' cancer was gone. ENDOMETRIAL CANCER PATIENTS SEE NEW HOPE AS FDA APPROVES 'TRANSFORMING' IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUG Today, Willits said, she is stable and healthy. \\\"I exercise every day. I'm a part of my family\\u2019s life every day. Cancer, we feel, is completely behind us \\u2014 and that was almost an impossible mission,\\\" she said. \\\"People ask me all the time, you know, how did you cure your cancer? And I say, \\u2018Well, God led me to Dr. Williams.\\u2019\\\" \\\"I cannot even imagine if I had stayed the course of traditional treatment and just tried to stop the progression,\\\" said Willits. (Tina Willits) Williams believes that immunotherapy is the future of cancer treatments. \\\"We first must target the tumor directly, injecting immunotherapy into it,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\\"In the future, the patient will be diagnosed with a suspicious lesion, and at the time of initial biopsy, we will begin treating it by injecting immunotherapy.\\\" While immunotherapy has shown promise as an alternate treatment, it does come with its own risks and limitations for certain groups of patients. WHY IMMUNOTHERAPY IS EMERGING AS THE \\u2018FOURTH PILLAR\\u2019 OF CANCER TREATMENTS, EXPERTS SAY \\\"Patients with autoimmune diseases have a higher risk, because the immune system is more primed to also attack normal tissues,\\\" Williams cautioned.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\\"Though risks are higher, we do have techniques to overcome this, and so the benefits outweigh the risks.\\\" \\\"As oncologists, we don\\u2019t want to expose a patient to a medication that can increase the risk of side effects without a clinical benefit.\\\" Brian Slomovitz, director of gynecologic oncology and co-chair of the Cancer Research Committee at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Florida, noted that immunotherapy has transformed the way many cancers are treated, but that it\\u2019s not always effective. \\\"It is important to understand that it is not useful in all patients,\\\" said Slomovitz, who was not involved in Willits' care.

I mean, it's out of my body. It's gone. Life is back to normal again. And I am so grateful.\\\" \\\"If we can get the word out, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of women we could potentially save,\\\" Willits said. (Tina Willits) While Willits\\u2019 prognosis is \\\"excellent,\\\" Williams emphasized that \\\"we must always be cautious and continue to monitor \\u2026 Any person who has had cancer before certainly has a higher than normal risk for another cancer or a recurrence.\\\" For more Health articles, visit\\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health For patients just starting their cancer journey, Williams says it\\u2019s critical to take the time to research the options thoroughly.\\u00a0 \\\"Numerous off-label medications and supplements that are available can help enhance treatment outcomes, and exploring immunotherapy should always be a priority,\\\" he added.
