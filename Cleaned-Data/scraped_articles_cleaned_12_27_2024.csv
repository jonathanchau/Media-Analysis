1,ABC,John Mateer commits to Oklahoma after Washington St. transfer,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/john-mateer-commits-oklahoma-after-washington-st-transfer/story?id=116930399,449,Max Olson,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Washington State transfer quarterback John Mateer has committed to Oklahoma, he announced on social media Wednesday. Mateer is the No. 1 overall player in ESPN's transfer rankings and joins the Sooners after a breakthrough season as the Cougars' starter in 2024. He will have two more seasons of eligibility. Oklahoma hired Washington State offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle and quarterbacks coach John Kuceyeski earlier this month and was long considered the favorite to land Mateer if he transferred. Oklahoma held off a strong push from Miami to secure his pledge, sources told ESPN. After backing up Cam Ward for two years, Mateer took over as the Cougars' starter in 2024 and threw for 3,139 yards and 29 touchdowns on 64.6% passing. He was one of the top dual-threat playmakers in the FBS, ranking sixth among quarterbacks with 826 rushing yards and scoring 15 rushing touchdowns. The 6-foot-1, 219-pound redshirt sophomore had a top-10 QBR among Group of 5 starters (71.4). The Cougars began 8-1 this season and were as high as No. 18 in the College Football Playoff rankings before closing with three consecutive losses. After firing first-year offensive coordinator Seth Littrell midway through the season, Oklahoma coach Brent Venables hired Arbuckle on Dec. 2. Mateer resolves a significant need for the program after starting quarterback Jackson Arnold opted to transfer to Auburn. Mateer, a native of Little Elm, Texas, was lightly recruited out of high school and was committed to play at the FCS level at Central Arkansas before Washington State made a late offer in January 2022. Washington State coach Jake Dickert accepted the job at Wake Forest on Wednesday, after longtime coach Dave Clawson decided to step down earlier this week.   Dickert and Washington State's leadership had attempted to negotiate a deal with Mateer to re-sign him for the 2025 season, but the coach said his quarterback wished to ""play on a bigger stage"" next season. ""John will be the most sought-after player in the portal,"" Dickert told reporters Monday. ""I think he's going to be the best player in the country next year."" In its first season as an SEC member, Oklahoma lost six of eight conference games and went 6-6 in the regular season. The Sooners rank No. 94 nationally in scoring offense at 24.3 points per game, their worst scoring average since 1998. Venables is counting on Mateer and Arbuckle, his rising 29-year-old offensive coordinator, to lead a turnaround in 2025. Oklahoma will close out its season against  Navy in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl on Dec. 27. Freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. started three games this season and was expected to start for the Sooners in the finale. "
2,ABC,Benched Will Levis: Still believe I can be Titans' franchise QB ,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/benched-levis-titans-franchise-qb/story?id=116924606,436,Turron Davenport,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Titans quarterback Will Levis found out Tuesday morning that he was getting reduced to a backup role this week. He was informed of his new role when he went to Titans coach Brian Callahan's office for their weekly meeting. The decision comes after Levis' four turnovers landed him on the bench in last week's 37-27 loss to the Bengals. The second-year quarterback was obviously disappointed about the decision but admitted he could have played better. With three games left, Levis said his plan is to take a day-by-day approach. That doesn't mean Levis feels the door is closed on his future with the Titans. ""I still believe that I can be the franchise quarterback for this team,"" Levis said Wednesday. ""I have the utmost confidence in myself and my ability to lead any team in this league."" In the meantime, Levis plans to do his best to help Mason Rudolph as the starting quarterback. Rudolph referred to the switch as an easy dynamic because he and Levis have a good relationship. Both players said it doesn't change anything or make things difficult. ""Obviously I'm sympathetic,"" Rudolph said. ""I know what it feels like for the switch to be made, but we've always had each other's backs. He's been supportive, and there's really been nothing weird about it."" Callahan said the decision to sit Levis was tough considering part of the first-year coach's job was maximizing the 2023 second-round pick's potential. ""I went back and watched a lot of things,"" Callahan said. ""It wasn't for lack of coaching or pouring into, I mean we've given at every turn as much as we can to try to put Will in position to succeed, and he's shown improvement. There's a lot of things he has improved at, but there hasn't been enough consistency at this moment."" When asked about Levis' future, Callahan said his focus is more on preparing to go win this week's game. He vowed to make sure he continued to coach Levis hard because he believes in the young quarterback's ability to play the position and still feels he can have a future. Levis said he saw a good example in how Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young bounced back after being benched earlier this season and reestablished himself as the team's future signal-caller. ""It happens to some of the best quarterbacks in the history of this game,"" Levis said. ""I remember the last time I got benched, I came back with a fury and put the best ball in my life the year after. So, I best see a similar thing happening for me."" "
3,ABC,Fashion influencer Matilda Djerf apologizes following report she created a toxic workplace,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/fashion-influencer-matilda-djerf-apologizes-report-created-toxic-116920263,427,Haleluya Hadero,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a work environment filled with fear and psychological pressure at her fashion brand A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a “work environment filled with fear and psychological pressure” at her fashion brand, Djerf Avenue. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was “genuinely sorry” to anyone she has “hurt or let down” after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a “culture of favoritism and control.” The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf. One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf whose company focuses on inclusivity said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too “fat” in the clothes. The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and “her favorites.” One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said. “When I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,” Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. “I wasn’t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.” The 27-year-old also said her business which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products was making “important changes” to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a “more experienced” management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.  Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.  Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes’ “30 under 30” list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.  Known for her “clean girl” aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber’s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."
4,ABC,Jay-Z's lawyers challenge rapper's inclusion in rape lawsuit after accuser's TV interview ,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/jay-zs-lawyers-challenge-rappers-inclusion-rape-lawsuit-116925610,531,Larry Neumeister,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Jay-Z’s lawyers are asking a judge to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs when she was 13 NEW YORK -- Jay-Z’s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs when she was 13. The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs’ limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party. In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story. The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers. In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators. In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z. Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours. Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the “beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.” In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations “have caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.” Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing. “They continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,” Buzzbee said. Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs. Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world’s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z’s net worth to be $2.5 billion. The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs’ debut album, “No Way Out” and Combs appearing on Jay-Z’s sophomore album, “In My Lifetime, Vol. 1.”"
5,ABC,Families express helplessness after cyclone rips through French island territory,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mayotte-families-express-helplessness-after-cyclone-chido-rips-116902597,883,"Sam Mednick, Adrienne Surprenant, Sylvie Corbet",2024-12-18,Weather,NA,NA,"Four days after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French island territory of Mayotte off the coast of Africa, survivors recalled the horror of a storm that caught many by surprise MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte -- They clustered around water taps, rare sources of electricity and each other. Four days after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French island territory of Mayotte off the coast of Africa, survivors recalled the horror of the storm that caught many by surprise. Associated Press journalists reached the humid capital before dusk, as French military personnel and others rushed to clear fallen palm trees from roads ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit Thursday. Streets were lined with the rubble of informal settlements whose migrant populations complicated the efforts to count the dead. “We lived something very apocalyptic,” said Samuel Anli, 28, who rode out Saturday's storm in a windowless office for hours as shrieking wind gusts exceeding 220 kph (136 mph) tore away doors and walls. He and others held the door to their small office shut, fearing for their lives. “We thought if it lasted one or two hours more we’d all be dead,” he said. His home was partly destroyed and three of his relatives were injured by flying metal. On Wednesday, French authorities described the storm as a ""catastrophe of exceptional intensity.” “The island is devastated,” they said, putting the confirmed death toll at 31 but noting that it could be much higher, partly because of the Muslim practice of burying the dead within 24 hours. Some survivors and aid groups have described hasty burials and the stench of bodies. Mayotte, located in the Indian Ocean between mainland Africa's east coast and northern Madagascar, is France’s poorest territory and is a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Europe. The cyclone devastated entire neighborhoods as many people ignored the warnings, thinking the storm wouldn't be so extreme. Days after it passed and destroyed or damaged even sturdy structures such as health centers, residents were left to pick their way through a landscape in search of food. Phone and internet service remained spotty. Among the damaged and destroyed homes in Mayotte's capital, Mamoudzou, people lined up with jugs to get water Wednesday or waited to charge their phones. Other lines stretched for hours at working gas stations. The French government deployed gendarmes and other security forces Wednesday to secure food distribution points and assure order in areas where crowds were massing to find fuel or phone signals, the Interior Ministry said in a statement, noting also that more than 8,800 people were being housed in emergency shelter.  Dozens of French military personnel set up camp at the primary airport on Mayotte's main island, Grand Terre, which remained closed due to damage, leaving most residents with little hope of going anywhere soon. Roads were also widely damaged. French Prime Minister François Bayrou has said more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically. But authorities fear hundreds or even thousands of people have died. Authorities said 100,000 were living in a “precarious situation.” On the French island of Reunion, about a three-hour flight away, loved ones gathered to donate aid to Mayotte's survivors. Some said their families in Mayotte had no food or water and that it had taken days to contact them. “It is difficult because I feel helpless,” said 19-year-old Khayra Djoumoi Thany. Anrafa Parassouramin said she feared for her relatives in Mayotte. “We are also afraid of disease outbreaks, because people are drinking water from wherever they can get it, and it’s not necessarily potable water,” she said. French Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has raised concerns about the risk of a cholera epidemic on the archipelago, which had an outbreak of a highly drug-resistant strain earlier this year. French authorities said distribution of 23 tons of water began Wednesday. The French minister for overseas matters, François-Noël Buffet, told French radio Europe 1 that the water supply system was “working at 50%” and presented a risk of “poor quality.” Electricity has been partially restored. Late Wednesday, Buffet announced a “state of extraordinary natural disaster” for Mayotte, an emergency declaration specifically for French overseas territories she said had never been activated before. The measure allows authorities to speed up assistance and cut through administrative hurdles. “Faced with this extraordinary situation, extraordinary means must be deployed to rapidly reestablish essential services and put in place a sustainable reconstruction plan for Mayotte,” she said in a statement. The decree will initially be in place for a month. Mayotte’s hospital was badly damaged. A field hospital should be operational by early next week, Buffet said. A navy ship was due to arrive in Mayotte on Thursday with 180 tons of aid and equipment, according to the French military. Macron will travel to Mayotte along with the aid shipment and visit the hospital and a destroyed neighborhood, his office said. “Our compatriots are living through the worst just a few thousand kilometers away,” Macron said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, a program on public broadcaster France 2 raised 5 million euros ($5.24 million) in aid for Mayotte through the Foundation of France charity, the channel said. Corbet reported from Paris. Associated Press reporter Angela Charlton in Paris contributed. "

A messy Monday morning commute on much of the East Coast is setting the scene for a roller coaster of temperatures throughout the country this week. Rain was falling along the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to New York early Monday morning, with freezing rain and snow occurring farther north in New Jersey, upstate New York and western Connecticut. Mixed precipitation added a glaze of ice to roadways, complicating commutes in parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Elsewhere, heavy rain and thunderstorms are moving across the Ohio River Valley on Monday, with a chance that storms could produce strong enough conditions to create severe weather with strong winds, hail or even spin up a tornado. The system will move east through the day, reaching Pittsburgh by 2 p.m., Buffalo by 5 p.m., Philadelphia by 7 p.m. and New York by 9 p.m., where it will rain for most of the overnight hours. Boston will get rain until about 8 a.m. on Tuesday, and residents through Maine will still be seeing rain until 10 a.m. Tuesday. The next shot of rain for the Northeast arrives Wednesday afternoon and should be out by Thursday morning. More rain will arrive in a separate system Monday evening over the Midwest from Indiana to Missouri and Arkansas, forecasts show. Following the rain will be a warmup then cooldown of temperatures in a matter of days, forecasts show. The Northeast will see a warming trend to start the week and a cooling trend to end the week. On Monday, temperatures up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit will be seen from Washington, D.C., to New York. Temperatures will climb to the 60s on Tuesday. D.C. could reach a daily record high on Tuesday -- the current record is 65 degrees set in 2021. On Wednesday, temperatures will begin to change again. Well-above-average temperatures are expected in the West, with near-daily record highs each day forecast for Phoenix from Wednesday through Saturday. Meanwhile, the East will be getting cooler for the latter half of the week and into the weekend. On Saturday, the western half of America will be very warm while the eastern half will be chilly. However, by the holiday week next week, much of the nation will be under the influence of above-average temperatures, forecasts show. "
7,ABC,"Jacob Elordi thinks Paul Schrader's cinema language in 'Oh, Canada' doesn't take long to learn",https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/jacob-elordi-thinks-paul-schraders-cinema-language-canada-116914075,671,Krysta Fauria,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood, so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming. Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming. Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers — Sofia Coppola's “Priscilla,” Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of “Frankenstein” and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's “Oh, Canada” — the 27-year-old isn’t taking his success for granted. “I don’t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, ‘I choose what is befitting of me,’” he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. “I’m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, ‘Wake me up from this.’” “Oh, Canada” tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life. Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks’ 2021 novel, “Foregone.” Despite their physical differences, Elordi’s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere’s mannerisms. “Richard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,” Elordi said. “The best one for physicality was ‘American Gigolo,’ because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it’s, you know, not far from where I am now.” Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he’s made his share of panned flops. But that hasn’t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage. “There’s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he’s right up at the top of it,” Elordi said. “As soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, ‘OK.’” Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he’s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he’s made. “To me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,” Schrader said. “I don’t expect that much from opening weekend.” Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: “If I get it made, that’s the first level of success. If it’s taken seriously, that’s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that’s the third.” While his films aren’t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 “First Reformed,” for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And “Oh, Canada” is not exactly action-packed. But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader’s movies aren’t accessible to a wide audience. “That kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,” he said. “There’s a language in cinema that doesn’t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.” Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity. “My mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She’s like, ‘Yeah, but the movie can’t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.’ And I’m like, ‘No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,’” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
8,ABC,"Jacob Collier enlisted 100,000 concertgoers on his way to more Grammy nods ",https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/jacob-collier-enlisted-100000-concertgoers-grammy-nods-116908932,530,Sian Watson,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Six-time Grammy winner Jacob Collier took an unexpected approach to the final installment of his four-part “Djesse” album series LONDON -- Six-time Grammy Award winner Jacob Collier, a fresh voice in contemporary jazz, took an unexpected approach to the final installment of the four-part album series, “Djesse Vol. 4.” Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions. One track on “Djesse Vol. 4” is titled “100,000 Voices,"" and it quite literally features that many singers. “There's like over 100,000 people on the album,” he says. “Over 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.” His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.  He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records. Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (“Djesse Vol. 3” was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's “folklore.”) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyoncé and Billie Eilish. “It's thrilling and wild,” he says of the honor. “The album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,” he says of “Djesse Vol. 4.” “I’m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it’s a really thrilling predicament.” Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be “a leader of a choir,” in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. “I really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,"" he says. ""And if they can feel welcome, then they’re a part of the music.” “Djesse Vol. 4” contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin. But now that Collier has completed the “Djesse” series, what's next? “I don’t have a clear idea of exactly what’s coming next, which I love, actually. Sometimes in life you need those moments of question marks,"" he says.  ""I’ve got like about a billion ideas, but I haven’t committed to any yet because I think I need a moment just to sort of recalibrate and see.” The 67th Grammy Awards will be held Feb. 2, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. The show will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+. "
9,ABC,Miss the snow? Experts explain why you may see less over the years ,https://abcnews.go.com/US/miss-snow-experts-explain-years/story?id=116632246,943,Kiara Alfonseca,2024-12-15,Weather,NA,NA,"The winter is the fastest warming season, according to Climate Central. Residents in some parts of the country are noticing how much less snow has fallen over the years, as snowshoes, cross-country skis and sleds gather dust in their closets. ""I'm getting kind of old -- I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to use those skis again without breaking something,"" joked Sarah Pregitzer, 70, from Grant, Michigan, in an interview with ABC News. ""Back in 2002, it seemed like our whole lives were surrounded by snow. It felt like summer never came,"" said Christine Smith, a resident of Canandaigua, New York. ""I feel like last year I only put my boots on twice."" ""I remember one time we even sledded for swim team practice instead of swimming inside,"" said Caitlin Harvey, a meteorologist for ABC affiliate KETV in Omaha, Nebraska. She recalls the superstitious rituals she would perform in order to secure their chances of a snow day as a child: throwing ice cubes around or performing a snow dance. ""But I haven't seen many snow days [since]. Those are fun times. It was always going to be a good day when we had a snow day."" Among the consequences of climate change is the warming of the winter, the fastest-warming season for much of the U.S., according to climate research group Climate Central. This means there are less freezing temperatures, but more moisture. New Jersey state climatologist and Rutgers University professor David Robinson -- who boasts he is known ""as a snowman"" -- explains that the impact of this on snowfall is complicated. For moisture to fall as snow, he says the air needs to be at or below the freezing point of 32 degrees, according to the NOAA. Even if cities nationwide are warming, those that remain cold enough will still get snow -- but once you go over that freezing point, what would have been snow in years past become rain events, said Robinson. And since warmer air can hold more moisture, some places will see increased rainfall take the place of some snowfall, according to Climate Central. If temperatures can get low enough, some regions will experience heavier snowstorms. ""A 30-degree snowstorm could provide more snow than a 20-degree snowstorm because you can have more moisture involved that comes out in the form of snow,"" said Robinson. In a Climate Central analysis of over 2,000 locations, 64% recorded less snow than they did in the early 1970s. The other 36% saw an increase. Pregitzer, who has lived in West Michigan for decades, remembers snow banks towering over her head as a child: ""Once winter started, winter stayed and there's something really nice about that winter. It's very cozy if you are able to adapt to it."" But the change in snowfall has wide-ranging implications for Americans beyond the nostalgia of the winter season, according to Climate Central Senior Research Associate Kaitlyn Trudeau. ""There's a lot of that that we're going to lose -- its impact on the economy, its impact on our culture. It's also impact on the environment, impact on water supplies,"" said Trudeau. Warmer weather and less snow mean there's a decline in snowpack and that snow melts earlier in regions like the West and Northern Great Plains region. Snowpack -- the accumulation and compression of snow on the ground -- sustains the water supply for many regions, supplying water for drinking, irrigation and more throughout the year, according to Trudeau. In the West, snowmelt supplies up to 75% of the water supply for some states, according to past U.S. Geological Survey data. Climate Central found that when there's less snowpack and the snow melts earlier, it increases wildfire risk, drought risk, and increased risks to agricultural and food production. In Nebraska, Harvey points to Nebraska's worsening fire season, which saw its second-worst season in 2022 and is currently facing some of its driest months on record. ""Here in Omaha, it seems like the dry air closer to the surface has been beating out any sort of moisture, snow or rain, especially this year,"" Harvey said. The multibillion-dollar winter recreation and tourism industry will also likely take an economic hit, with shorter seasons and less snow to line the trails, according to Trudeau. Residents experiencing less snow have mixed feelings about the changes -- some miss the silence of a holiday snowfall or the thrill of winter sports while others bask in their freedom from slushy roads and shivering in the cold. ""To have an extra layer of the weather as a worry is not really something that I think anybody wants to deal with,"" said Smith. Meanwhile Trudeau, who grew up in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, has been on the hunt for a long snow season. ""I'm hoping to one day to be in a place where it snows a lot, but sadly, I think that my chances of that happening might be pretty, pretty slim,"" Trudeau said. ""There really are impacts that will affect people more so than I think they realize."" But Robinson says not to put away the winter gear for good. Though snow may become less common, the complexities of how snowfall is impacted means there are still many chances for powerful storms to ""come along and surprise you.""

The arctic blast impacting much of the continental U.S. may be ending soon, but one region is bracing another cold-related weather event this week. The eastern half of the U.S. from Minnesota to northern Florida and up to New England was blanketed in frigid conditions on Friday morning, a continuation of freezing temperatures experienced all over the country in recent days. Wind chills Friday morning were below zero degrees Fahrenheit in Minneapolis, near-zero in Chicago and in the teens and single digits in the Northeast. Temperatures are near freezing in northern Florida and southern Georgia, where a frost advisory was issued. Lake effect snow -- the result of cold air moving over the Great Lakes while they are still ice-free -- brought 3.5 feet of snow to western New York and up to 20 inches to northern lower Michigan on Thursday. Winds gusted to near 40 mph, creating whiteout conditions in heaviest lake-effect snow bands. On Friday morning, the lake effect snow warning continued for Ohio, Pennsylvania and western New York, where some areas could accumulate between 6 inches and a foot of snow, forecasts show. The cold air will last for one more day on Saturday before a moderating trend begins on Sunday and into next week for most of the East. However, a new storm system is moving into the Plains and the Midwest Friday into Saturday morning. The National Weather Service has issued an ice storm warning for Iowa and other ice alerts from Kansas to Minnesota. Cities like Des Moines, Minneapolis and Omaha are under alerts later from Friday and into Saturday morning. Freezing rain could glaze roads to more than a half an inch, creating treacherous driving conditions. Heavy precipitation when temperatures are below freezing can create an ice storm, according to the National Weather Service. Accumulations of ice can down trees, communication towers and utility poles, according to the NWS. In addition, ice storms can create black ice -- patchy ice on roadways or other transportation surfaces that cannot easily be seen -- and ice jams in lakes and streams, which can contribute to severe flooding, the NWS said. The NWS advises residents under threat of a winter storm to make sure homes, vehicles and offices are stocked with necessary supplies, such as chargers, food, first aid kids, fuel and jumper cables. The agency also advised residents to make sure pets and farm animals have the essentials they need."
11,Newsmax,"With Correct Measurements, Wine Really May Protect Heart ",https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/wine-heart-health/2024/12/18/id/1192109/,547,Dennis Thompson,2024-12-18,Health,NA,NA,"A little wine every day can protect your heart health, a new study suggests. People who drank half to one glass of wine a day had a 50% lower risk of heart attack, stroke or heart disease, compared to wine teetotalers, researchers reported Dec. 18 in the European Heart Journal. Even light drinking – one glass a week, or less than half a glass a day – reduced heart risk by 38%, results showed. However, these benefits evaporated in people who had more than one glass of wine a day. ""We have found a much greater protective effect of wine than that observed in other studies,"" said senior researcher Dr. Ramon Estruch, a professor with the University of Barcelona. ""A reduction in risk of 50% is much higher than can be achieved with some drugs, such as statins,"" Estruch added in a journal news release. These more potent protections were uncovered because this study used a more precise method of measuring people's wine intake, the release explained. Prior studies rely on people reporting how much wine they drink, Estruch said. Such memories might be mistaken, or people might fib because they are embarrassed about their wine drinking. But this study, part of a larger Spanish research project investigating the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, tracked people's wine intake by measuring the amount of tartaric acid in their urine. Tartaric acid is a chemical naturally found in grapes and grape products like wine. It is excreted in urine, and can be measured to show if someone has consumed wine or grapes within the past five to six days. For this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 1,200 people. During as much as five years of follow-up, there were 685 cases of heart attack, stroke, and heart disease. In people at high risk of heart disease following a Mediterranean diet, light-to-moderate wine drinking reduced heart risk by 50%, results show. ""Until now, we believed that 20% of the effects of the Mediterranean diet could be attributed to moderate wine consumption,"" Estruch said. ""However, in light of these results, the effect may be even greater."" Estruch also noted because these participants were older people at high risk of heart disease living in Spain, the study's results might not apply to other people. ""Another key question is at what age moderate wine consumption could be considered 'acceptable.' Recent studies indicate that the protective effects of wine consumption are observed starting from the age of 35 to 40,"" Estruch said. ""It is also important to note that moderate consumption for women should always be half that of men, and it should be consumed with meals."" This study could have ""far-reaching"" implications for public health recommendations regarding wine consumption, according to an editorial accompanying the study. ""The use of an objective biomarker such as urinary tartaric acid represents a significant methodological advancement in alcohol research,"" wrote the editorial group led by Dr. Giovanni de Gaetano, head of epidemiology and prevention for the IRCCS NEUROMED Department of Epidemiology and Prevention in Pozzilli, Italy. ""It offers a more accurate and reliable measure of wine consumption, which could help resolve some of the ongoing debates about the health effects of alcohol,"" the editorial added.

""This trend in the reduction of substance use among teenagers is unprecedented,"" said Dr. Nora Volkow, who directs the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). ""We must continue to investigate factors that have contributed to this lowered risk of substance use to tailor interventions to support the continuation of this trend."" The new data comes from NIDA's web-based Monitoring the Future survey of teens, with responses up to June of 2024. The survey tracks the self-reported behaviors of kids in the 8th, 10th and 12th grades nationwide. As might have been expected, forced out of school and quarantined at home, many teens stopped using drugs and alcohol during the 2020-2021 pandemic years, the data showed. The good news is that numbers have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, use of alcohol and various drugs by American teens has either held steady or dipped slightly, the survey found. Some of the main findings: Alcohol. About 12.9% of eighth graders said they drank at least once over the past year, a number thats largely unchanged from the year before. Among 10th graders, use actually fell from 30.6% in 2023 to 26.1% in 2024, and among 12th graders, past-year alcohol intake dropped from 45.7% in 2023 to 41.7% this year. Vaping. Nicotine vaping rates among 8th graders held steady from 2023 to 2024, at about 9.6%, and for 12th graders the rate of nicotine vape use was stable at about 21%. Tenth graders even experienced a slight decline in past-year nicotine vaping rates -- from 17.6% in 2023 to 15.4% by 2024. Cannabis. Again, rates of use of any kind of marijuana (vapes, joints, gummies) have stabilized for 8th graders, with only 7.2% reporting use over the past year. Rates of weed use declined among 12th graders -- from 29% in 2023 to 25.8% this year. When it came to vaped weed, specifically, rates of past-year use held steady among 8th graders (5.6%), 10th graders (11.6%) and 12th graders (17.6%). Illicit drugs other than marijuana. Self-reported past-year use of these drugs fell considerably among 8th graders (from 4.6% in 2023 to 3.4% in 2024), and remained stable among 10th graders (4.4%) and 12th graders (6.5%), the data showed. That continues a longstanding trend of kids migrating away from ""hard"" drugs, NIDA said. This included a continued decline in use of narcotics such as Percocet, Vicodin and Oxycontin, the research team found. Overall, the kids are alright: The NIDA data shows 89.5% of eighth graders saying that over the past month they've stayed away from marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine. There was a slight uptick in past-month use of these substances for 10th graders (from 76.9% in 2023 to 80.2% in 2024) and 12th graders (from 62.6% in 2023 to 67.1% a year later). The overall news is good, however. ""Kids who were in eighth grade at the start of the pandemic will be graduating from high school this year, and this unique cohort has ushered in the lowest rates of substance use we've seen in decades,"" Richard Miech, team lead of the Monitoring the Future survey, said in the release.

13,Newsmax,Is it More Than the Winter Blues? ,https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/winter-short-days/2024/12/17/id/1192019/,745,Lynn C. Allison,2024-12-17,Health,NA,NA,"Winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, occurs this Saturday, December 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. Many people feel the effects both mentally and physically of less sunlight. You might feel sad, tired or anxious during these dark days but sometimes the “winter blues” can develop into something more serious. According to Study Finds, when people experience daily, persistent symptoms of mood changes and lethargy, they may be suffering from seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.  About 10 million Americans experience SAD, which is a form of depression that usually affects people from mid to late fall through the early days of spring. “The most common misconception is that it is ‘just’ winter blues and not that big of a deal,” said Dr. Jeff Temple, licensed psychologist and professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.  “On the contrary, it impacts millions of Americans with symptoms consistent with major depression.” Experts say that SAD can be potentially triggered by a lack of serotonin, the mood-regulating brain chemical that dims with less daylight. Less exposure to the sun’s rays also reduces vitamin D levels, which support serotonin levels and metabolism. Dr. Norman Rosenthal, author of Defeating SAD: A Guide to Health and Happiness Through All Seasons, who first described SAD and pioneered the use of light therapy in its treatment, tells Newsmax that several factors contribute to feeling blue in the winter. “These include a genetic component, stress, and a lack of environmental light,” he explains. “We can feel sad at any time of the year and it’s part of the normal palette of human emotions. For example, we feel sad when we fail to reach a goal, have a setback, or lose someone we love. But SAD is a specific condition that affects people predominantly during the winter months.”  Your doctor can diagnose SAD with a detailed medical examination and psychiatric evaluation. Here are some proven therapies to treat SAD: • Get more light. Rosenthal says you should go outdoors as often as you can. “Even on a winter day you can get a lot of light coming from the sky,” he says. If you can’t get out, he suggests bringing more light fixtures indoors. “You can buy those specially built for treating SAD. The lightbox should be big enough —at least one foot square, made by a reputable manufacturer, and ideally used in the morning or any time of day.” The light boxes give off 10,000 lux which is a unit of illuminance says USA Today. Make sure the boxes are equipped with UV filters to protect your skin and follow the directions carefully. Tanning beds are not effective, say experts. • Exercise regularly. Physical activity has been shown to boost mood, decrease the symptoms of depression and reduce stress, according to the American Psychological Association. Start slowly and build up to 30 to 60 minutes a day, five days a week. Find an activity you like to do so that you will be more likely to stick with it. • Try to minimize stress. Rosenthal says we should try to identify our stressors, and if they are unavoidable, figure out ways to deal with them. Very often, being indoors means more screen time so try to limit your exposure to negative news and limit the amount of time you spend staring at a screen. • Boost your mood with food. Heidi Hanna, a leading psychologist and expert on the mind-body connection, tells Newsmax that choosing foods carefully can curb sugar and carbohydrate cravings throughout the day and help stabilize your mood. “Include a balance of natural sources of complex carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fat that keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day. You should also consume a rainbow of produce to provide antioxidants,” she says. Foods rich in vitamin D such as fatty fish, fish oil, vitamin D fortified foods like milk, orange juice, breakfast cereal and yogurt can help the winter blues. • Psychotherapy. Counseling, especially cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT, may help people with SAD. By learning new ways of dealing with emotions, sufferers can change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors, according to Study Finds. CBT-SAD is a special form of therapy designed to treat people suffering from the disorder that is usually conducted in two weekly group sessions for six weeks. People learn to replace negative thoughts about the season with more positive thoughts. Lynn C.

14,Newsmax,Team Sports Boost Kids' Executive Function Skills,https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/sports-teams-children/2024/12/17/id/1192007/,610,Ernie Mundell,2024-12-17,Health,NA,NA,"There may be something special about team sports in childhood that helps sharpen a kids' brain, new research shows. Children who were on soccer or volleyball teams scored higher on tests of ""executive function"" — thinking skills needed to organize, remember details, make decisions and stay focused — compared to kids who didn't play sports or played individual sports only, the new study discovered. ""Scientific data indicate that playing a team sport like soccer improves executive function skills, which are among the most key life skills of all,"" Dr. Alison Brooks wrote in a journal commentary accompanying the new study. She's professor of orthopedics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The new study was published Dec. 17 in the journal JAMA Network Open. It was conducted in The Netherlands and led by Lu Yang, a graduate medical student at the University Medical Center Groningen. Yang's team looked at data on almost 900 schoolchildren tracked from 2006 through 2017. The kids were assessed at two age periods: Ages 5 to 6 and then again at 10 to 11. Data was compiled on their daily physical activity (including sports participation), and they were also given cognitive tests measuring executive function at around the age of 11. The research showed that ""moderate"" levels of overall physical activity in early life had no significant impact on the kids' executive function at age 11. There was one exception, however. ""Children participating in team sports at ages 10 and 11 years consistently exhibited superior executive function compared with participants in individual sports,"" Yang and colleagues reported. Example of team sports the kids routinely engaged in were soccer and volleyball; individual sports included martial arts, swimming or gymnastics. How might playing on a team sharpen a kids' decision-making, organization and other skills? Team sports place kids under ""high cognitive demands,"" the researchers noted, ""due to uncertainty from interactions with teammates and opponents; thus, players must rapidly and dynamically respond."" All of this means that ""team sports may serve as practice grounds for enhancing executive function,"" they concluded. In her commentary, Brooks noted that the Dutch kids' participation in group sports was high — only 6.3% of the kids in the study played no sport. However, U.S. kids can expect to reap the same cognitive rewards from team sports, she believes. Brooks pointed to a 2019 American Academy of Pediatrics report on the value of organized sports for kids. She said it found benefits to ""positive self-esteem and relationships with peers, less anxiety and depression, better bone health"" as well as healthier hearts, less obesity and ""better cognitive and academic performance."" Unfortunately, too few American children can reap these benefits, because ""according to the 2022 National Survey of Children's Health, only 53.8% of U.S. children aged 6 to 17 years participated on a sports team,"" Brooks said. By the age of 13, 70% of U.S. kids are playing no sports at all, the data showed. These stats rise even higher among kids from poorer and minority families, and cost (""pay to play"") could be one big factor, according to Brooks. There's also increasing pressure to ""professionalize"" youth sports, making participation less appealing. ""By creating barriers to both sports entry and sustained sports participation, we may be denying children an opportunity to develop their full and true potential as humans,"" Brooks wrote. She said that, besides being an expert in the value of sports for kids' health, she's also a former soccer player and a mom. ""Now is the time for me to drop my child at soccer practice so he can enhance his executive functioning, and while he is at it, maybe learn to bend it like Beckham,"" Brooks said."

NASA announced Tuesday that the launch for SpaceX's Crew-10 mission has been pushed to no earlier than late March. One of the mission's objectives is to return Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to Earth. They reached the space station on June 5 on Boeing's new Starliner crew capsule for a weeklong test, but were forced to stay when NASA determined a series of thruster failures and helium leaks in the Boeing capsule made it too risky for them to return. Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Williams and Wilmore to a SpaceX flight that was scheduled for late February. But NASA said in a blog post it and SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, need time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission. The new spacecraft is set to arrive at SpaceX's processing facility in Florida in early January. ""Fabrication, assembly, testing, and final integration of a new spacecraft is a painstaking endeavor that requires great attention to detail,"" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in the blog post. ""We appreciate the hard work by the SpaceX team to expand the Dragon fleet in support of our missions and the flexibility of the station program and expedition crews as we work together to complete the new capsule's readiness for flight."" NASA said it and SpaceX assessed various options for managing the next crewed handover, including using another Dragon spacecraft. ""After careful consideration, the team determined that launching Crew-10 in late March, following completion of the new Dragon spacecraft, was the best option for meeting NASA's requirements and achieving space station objectives for 2025,"" NASA said in the blog post. SpaceX's Crew 10 will be composed of NASA astronauts Anne McClain, the mission commander, and pilot Nichole Ayers; Takuya Onishi, a mission specialist with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; and Russian cosmonaut and mission specialist Kirill Peskov. Returning with Williams and Wilmore will be NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.

The spacecraft passed just 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface on Dec. 24, flying into the sun's outer atmosphere called the corona, on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth's closest star. The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday. The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on Jan. 1, NASA added. Moving at up to 430,000 mph (692,000 kph), the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (982 degrees Celsius), according to the NASA website. ""This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,"" the agency added. The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer towards the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun. "

The United Airlines pilot and the second, who was flying a medical evacuation plane over Siuslaw National Forest, both reported unidentified circular red lights moving erratically toward the Pacific Ocean and darting back at varying altitudes, according to Newsweek. One pilot said the object was moving in corkscrew patterns at extreme speeds. ""Looking straight west to Eugene.

18,Newsmax,Hundreds Feared Dead on Mayotte after Cyclone Chido ,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/mayotte-cyclone-chido/2024/12/15/id/1191727/,759,Unknown,2024-12-15,Weather,NA,NA,"A senior official said Sunday that the death toll from cyclone Chido's passage across Mayotte would be in the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, as France rushed in rescue workers and supplies. Their efforts will be hindered by the damage to airports and electricity distribution in the French Indian Ocean territory. Even before the cyclone's passage, clean drinking water was already subject to chronic shortages. ""I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand"" deaths, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere. It would be ""very difficult to reach a final count"" given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc. ""Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of cyclone Chido through Mayotte,"" she posted on X. ""We are ready to provide support in the days to come."" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also offered support, writing on X that his organisation ""stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care"". PIROI, the Red Cross organisation in the region, said on X that it was ready to intervene. Earlier Sunday, the mayor of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP nine were in a critical condition in hospital, with another 246 more seriously injured. ""The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated,"" he said. The storm had ""spared nothing"", he added. Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that France's interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte. Some of them did not dare to venture out and seek assistance, ""fearing it would be a trap"" designed to remove them from Mayotte,"" said Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse. Many had stayed put ""until the last minute"" when it proved to late to escape the cyclone, she added. The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelago's shantytown, France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late Saturday. Mayotte's 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown Saturday as cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres (310 miles) east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour. Electricity poles were hurled to the ground, trees uprooted and sheet-metal roofs and walls torn off the shantytown housing inhabited by at least one-third of the population. One local resident, Ibrahim, told AFP of ""apocalyptic scenes"" as he made his way through the main island, having to clear blocked roads for himself. Retailleau will travel to Mayotte on Monday, his office said, with 160 soldiers and firefighters to reinforce the 110 already deployed to the islands. Pope Francis, visiting French Mediterranean island Corsica on Sunday, urged people to pray for Mayotte's residents. French President Macron promised they would act to help the people there. Already Sunday, medical personnel and equipment were delivered Sunday by air and sea. The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte. It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow. A navy patrol ship was also to depart La Reunion with personnel and equipment including for electricity supplier EDF. Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage. Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said. The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials. UNICEF said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm. ""Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with the government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,"" it said in a statement. Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts. The ""exceptional"" cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told AFP. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that some 1.7 million people were in danger, and said the remnants of the cyclone could also dump ""significant rainfall"" on neighbouring Malawi through Monday, potentially triggering flash floods. Zimbabwe and Zambia could also expect heavy rains, it added."
19,Newsmax,Milan's Brera Boosts Its Cultural Cachet with an Overdue Modern Art Wing and Leonardo's Last Supper ,https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/italy-milan-brera-modern-art-collection/2024/12/08/id/1190775/,810,Colleen Barry,2024-12-08,Culture,NA,NA,"Milan’s Pinacoteca di Brera museum, conceived under Napoleon as a “little Louvre,” is finally getting a modern art addition first envisioned more than 50 years ago with the opening Sunday of Palazzo Citterio, home to one of the world’s most important collections of 20th century Italian art. Completing the project long beset by shifting priorities, periods of neglect and most recently an ill-fated architectural vision was a priority for Brera director Angelo Crespi when he took over in January. Italy's then-culture minister set Dec. 7 — the feast day for Milan’s patron St. Ambrose — as the target opening date, giving Crespi just months to resolve structural issues and oversee the installation of hundreds of modern works of art donated to the Brera decades ago. On deadline, the current culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, who inherited the project in September, inaugurated Palazzo Citterio on Saturday’s feast day, ahead of the public opening on Sunday. The accelerated timeline after decades of delays “wasn’t to prove something,"" Crespi told The Associated Press. “There was awareness that it needed to be opened,"" he said. ""The question was not just economic, but also ethical. After 52 years, we couldn’t keep such a beautiful building closed simply because of inertia.” The Palazzo Citterio opening completes a decades-old vision for a “Grande Brera,” which encompasses also the Pinacoteca and the Braidense National Library, just as it takes on greater heft in the Italian cultural landscape.  From Dec. 2, the Grande Brera also incorporated into its fold Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” arguably Italy’s most famous masterpiece. The fragile wall mural is located in a church complex a kilometer (half a mile) away from the Pinacoteca and Palazzo Citterio. The merger creates a system of state-run museums in Milan that boosts Brera’s cachet and gives Crespi significant autonomy in their management, including control over 80% of revenue. Combined, the “Last Supper,” and the Pinacoteca di Brera, receive 1 million visitors a year, and take in more than 10 million euros ($10.5 million) in revenue, Crespi said. As a single entity, they are among the top 10 most-visited sites in Italy. Crespi hopes to use this greater visibility to promote other institutes in the Brera complex, including the Academy of Fine Arts, botanical gardens and an observatory, while also pitching Milan — better known for fashion and finance — as a city of the arts. Beside the Grande Brera’s vast collections and the “Last Supper,” masterpieces by Michelangelo, Canova, Caravaggio, Raffaello, Bellini, Piero della Francesca and others are displayed in museums and landmarks within walking distance of Milan's central Duomo cathedral. Yet they are often overlooked by visitors. “All of the biggest masterpieces and names who made Italian art great over the centuries are concentrated within a few hundred meters,” Crespi said, adding that as an art city, Milan can rival Florence, Rome and Venice. The Grande Brera should become “the motor of this narration of Milan as a city of art,"" he said. By spring, the Pinacoteca di Brera will be linked to Palazzo Citterio, a few minutes' walk away, by a passageway through the botanical gardens behind the museums.  Inside Palazzo Citterio, visitors are greeted by the monumental late 19th century painting “Human Flood,” by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, intended as a bridge from the Pinacoteca's collection that is rich in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art taken from areas conquered by Napoleon's army.  In the new museum, hundreds of artworks donated to the Brera decades ago by the art collectors Emilio Jesi and Lamberto Vitali form “a manual of Italian contemporary art,” with a particular focus on Giorgio Morandi, said curator Marina Gargiulo.  Jesi, who lived in an apartment in the palazzo, focused his collection on painters who were his contemporaries in the 1930-1960s, most of them Italian artists, with notable exceptions including Picasso.  Vitali's tastes were more eclectic, ranging from archaeological artifacts to Byzantine mosaics and art from the medieval era through the 20th century, with paintings by his friend Morandi and by Modigliani, Gargiulo said.  The new museum also includes a series of 152 miniature self-portraits commissioned by Italian neorealistic screenwriter Cesare Zavattini.  Workers were still installing the permanent collection and an exhibition two days before the public opening, and Crespi said his own staff suggested postponing the opening as the date neared. But he held fast. “Otherwise, we could have entered in a new loop, with more years of other ideas, other projects. It is the right moment and we need to do it,” Crespi said. For now, the Palazzo Citterio will be open Thursday-Sunday from 2 p.m.-7 p.m., while the Pinacoteca di Brera is open Tuesday-Sunday from 8:30 a.m. until 7:15 p.m. Reservations are recommended for Leonardo’s Last Supper Museum, open from 8:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, with a maximum 40 people admitted every 15 minutes."
20,Newsmax,Man Who Bought Banana Art for $6.2M Eats Fruit | Newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/hong-kong-banana-art/2024/11/29/id/1189790/,384,Kanis Lueng,2024-11-29,Culture,NA,NA,"A cryptocurrency entrepreneur who bought a piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, for $6.2 million last week ate the fruit in Hong Kong on Friday. Chinese-born Justin Sun peeled off the duct tape and enjoyed the banana in a press conference held in The Peninsula Hong Kong, one of the city's priciest hotels, in the popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui. ""It tastes much better than other bananas. Indeed, quite good,"" he said. ""Comedian,"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or a cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point, another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time. Last week, Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, made the winning bid at the Sotheby’s auction in New York. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it ""Comedian."" At the time, Sun said in a statement that the piece ""represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community."" ""I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture,"" he said. The South China Morning Post reported the banana he ate on Friday was bought in Hong Kong. Sun on Tuesday announced on X he had invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, which was launched by President-elect Donald Trump in September as his family's cryptocurrency venture. Sun said in the post that his platform, TRON, is “committed to making America great again and leading innovation."" Following his investment in Trump's venture, he became an adviser of World Liberty Financial. Last year, Sun was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and other securities law violations. In response, he said on X the complaint ""lacks merit."" "
21,CNN,Jay-Z’s attorney says rape claim against him is made up: ‘This never happened’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/entertainment/jay-z-attorney/index.html,863,"Elizabeth Wagmeister, Lauren del Valle",2024-12-16,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Jay-Z’s lawyer Alex Spiro told reporters in New York on Monday that allegations from a woman who has accused the hip-hop mogul of sexually assaulting her with Sean “Diddy” Combs back in 2000 are untrue. “This is all a fantasy,” Spiro told reporters, including CNN, at a private meeting held at Jay-Z’s Roc Nation offices in New York City on Monday. “We expect the case to be dismissed. If it’s not, we expect this all to crumble.” Spiro showed a Powerpoint presentation to a small room of reporters, walking through the timeline of the allegations from the accuser’s lawsuit that he said are demonstrably false. “None of the details are right because this never happened,” Spiro said. “When something isn’t real and when something doesn’t happen, you’re going to get the details wrong because you weren’t really there.” In an amended complaint filed by the woman as Jane Doe, she accused Jay-Z of raping her at an afterparty for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, when she 13. Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, was previously unnamed in her original complaint, which was initially filed in October against Combs. Carter denied her allegations immediately when the amended complaint was filed. Spiro’s presentation to reporters was made days after Doe admitted in an interview with NBC News that there are inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses, while maintaining her rape accusation against Carter. “I have made some mistakes,” Doe told the outlet. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.” “This is not an account of inconsistencies,” Spiro said Monday. “This never happened. This is completely false.” In Doe’s complaint against Combs and Carter, she said that she was taken to an afterparty after meeting a limo driver, who claimed to work for Combs, outside of Radio City Music Hall, where the MTV event was held. Spiro said that the limousine line was blocked off and guarded by police to prevent public access. Spiro also showed reporters photographs of Carter, Combs and other celebrities at a VMA afterparty, held at a commercial establishment in New York City. He said Doe’s story was not plausible because of the time it would take to travel from the city to the suburbs, where the alleged party was held. Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, had previously been accused by Spiro of trying to extort Carter prior to making his name public in the amended filing. In an email to CNN, Buzbee called Spiro’s accusations regarding him and his client “baseless” and said “courts exist to resolve factual disputes.” When asked about his vetting process, Buzbee said that four individuals at his firm “interviewed the client and checked details” after Doe’s original case was referred by another firm. Buzbee said that a background check was run on Doe, and his firm “engaged a seasoned investigator to vet some details she disclosed to us.” “Those results were consistent with what the client had told us,” Buzbee said, adding that his client has signed two separate affidavits. “Our client remains adamant about her claim,” he told CNN. Spiro took aim at Buzbee again on Monday, accusing him of shaking down celebrities, including Carter. “People like this, they don’t send demand letters out to not get money. This is not for truth and justice. This is for money,” Spiro said. Spiro told CNN last week that he plans to ask the court to dismiss the case and that he’d seek disciplinary action against Buzbee and his team. Carter is “upset” about the allegations against him brought forth by Buzbee, Spiro said Monday. Jay-Z’s attorney describes how Jay-Z is doing after accusations made against him. “He’s upset that somebody would be allowed to do this, to make a mockery of the system like this. He’s upset that this distracts and dissuades real victims from coming forward,” Spiro said. “He’s upset that his kids and his family have to deal with this. He’s upset. And he should be upset.” Prior to Buzbee filing Doe’s amended complaint, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.” Buzbee told CNN Carter’s extortion case is “utterly frivolous.” Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN. “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab,” they said. As for the mounting civil allegations and criminal charges against Combs, Spiro distanced Carter from his case. “Mr. Carter has nothing to do with Mr. Combs’ case or Mr. Combs. They knew each other professionally for a number years, just like in all professions,” Spiro said. “There is no closer association between any of them. That’s also a matter of fiction. That’s all that there is. He doesn’t know anything about the charges or allegations against him. He has nothing to do with that case and there’s nothing more to say.”"

The Oscar-winning actor was injured at a dinner held in Beverly Hills, California, in honor of his birthday, according to his spokesperson. “Jamie Foxx was at his birthday dinner when someone from another table threw a glass that hit him in the mouth,” a spokesperson for Foxx said. “He had to get stitches and is recovering. The police were called and the matter is now in law enforcement’s hands.” The Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed that officers responded to “a reported possible assault with a deadly weapon at Mr. Chow restaurant,” but did not name Foxx. Foxx on Sunday shared a post on social media that read, “The devil is busy…but I’m too blessed to be stressed.” A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) “The devil is a lie. Can’t win here… thank you to everybody that pray and check on me… when your light is shining bright… they try to bring you darkness … but they don’t know that you’re built for it… the lights have been shining bright…,” Foxx wrote in the caption. He also thanked “everyone that have watched and been inspired by” his new Netflix stand-up special, “What Had Happened Was.” “It’s from my heart and my soul,” Foxx wrote. The special marks the first time Foxx shared what happened in April 2023, when he was hospitalized in Atlanta, Georgia, following a medical incident. According to Foxx, he doesn’t remember 20 days that he was hospitalized as a result of a brain bleed he said doctors told him resulted in a stroke."
23,CNN,"Get more active to extend your life expectancy, study suggests",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/health/physical-activity-extend-life-expectancy-wellness/index.html,1123,Kristen Rogers,2024-11-15,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts. In a busy world, the task of getting more movement into your daily life can often get put on the back burner. But there’s a reason to rethink your priorities — getting as active as the top 25% of the US population could extend your life by at least five years, according to a new study published Thursday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. “I was surprised to find that the loss of life years in the USA due to low levels of physical activity might rival the losses due to smoking and high blood pressure,” said senior study author Dr. Lennert Veerman, professor of public health in the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Griffith University in Australia, via email. Many studies have examined the connections between physical activity and longevity. In fact, Veerman’s research was inspired by a 2019 study that found the risk of premature death lowered the more physical activity participants did, he said. The activity levels in that study were measured with accelerometers — wearable activity-tracking devices. The 2019 study, along with others, had already shown that when measured with accelerometry, the relationship between physical activity and early death is about twice as strong when compared with levels gauged by surveys or questionnaires, Veerman said. “I wondered how that would translate to life expectancy, and how much extra life time a single hour of walking might bring,” Veerman added. To find out, the authors of the latest study used physical activity data captured by hip accelerometers worn — for at least 10 hours on four or more days — by adults who were age 40 or older when participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2003 to 2006. The findings are based on this age group because activity-dependent mortality rates are stable up to age 40; after that, they vary. And the reason for using old activity data is for methodological consistency with the 2019 study, the authors said. The team then constructed a life table — a way of showing the probabilities of populations living to, or dying by, a certain age. This life table was based on the National Center for Health Statistics’ mortality data for 2017, which the authors assumed was related to the 2003-2006 activity levels. Based on this information, the authors projected forward how many people from the 2019 US population would survive in the coming years depending on activity levels, and how much extra life they could gain by increasing them. They found that being as active as the least active quartile of the population would lead to a 5.8-year loss in life expectancy for men and women, bringing the expectancy at birth down from around 78 to around 73. And if all Americans over age 40 were as active as the top quartile, life expectancy would be 83.7 years, which is an increase of 5.3 years. Total activity levels in the lowest quartile were equivalent to walking for 49 minutes at roughly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) per hour daily. Total activity levels in the second-, third- and fourth-highest quartiles were equivalent to 78, 105 and 160 minutes, respectively. The team also investigated what the potential benefits could be on an individual, rather than population, level — finding that if those who are the least active got an extra 111 minutes of activity per day, they could prolong their life by up to 11 years. The findings “suggest sort of what we’ve already known, which is that physical activity is pretty critical to improve health outcomes (and) improve longevity,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, who wasn’t involved in the study. (Freeman is also a medical adviser for WeWard, an activity-tracking app that also incentivizes users to move by letting them accrue points they can redeem for prizes or charity donations. He hasn’t received any financial compensation.) The authors’ modeling method is strong but does have its limitations since it relies on existing data and provides estimates that are largely theoretical, said Dr. Peter Katzmarzyk, associate executive director for population and public health sciences at the Louisiana State University’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center, via email. Katzmarzyk wasn’t involved in the study. The authors acknowledged there is some evidence that adherence to physical activity guidelines in the United States has improved since the mid-2000s, meaning their projections on life expectancy could be overestimated. The activity levels of the participants in the 2003-2006 study were also measured at just one point in time, which can’t account for changes across their lifetimes. But researchers have already suggested exactly how movement could be linked to longevity. “Physical inactivity is associated with the development of several diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several cancers,” Katzmarzyk said. “Being physically active reduces your risk of developing these conditions and dying from them.” If the idea of becoming more active seems daunting, know that the activity levels of participants in the 2003-2006 study weren’t all from exercise. They wore trackers on their hips for at least 10 waking hours for multiple days, which means the devices captured movements necessary for day-to-day life, too. Find more moments to move throughout your day. While your food’s heating up, do some squats or take a lap around your work building instead of scrolling through social media. When you’re running errands, park as far away from stores as possible. Getting coffee with a friend? Catch up during a walk in the park instead of sitting in the coffee shop. Standing desks or desk treadmills can be great to have at work, Freeman said. Adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week, according to the World Health Organization. Every movement counts, Veerman said, so don’t count yourself out if you don’t meet the guidelines. The study found a diminishing returns effect, so exercising for 23 hours a day doesn’t mean you’ll live forever, Freeman said. There is such a thing as too much activity. Additionally, “the authors’ points about enhancing the pedestrian infrastructure … are critical,” said Freeman, who added that patients returning from trips to Europe often tell him they walked 10,000 or 20,000 steps daily. “We need to figure out how to do that here in the States,” he said, “because our expenditures in health care are just completely unsustainable.” Reducing dependence on cars requires collective action and long-term planning, but everyone can advocate for this change, and some people are already positioned to help make it happen, Veerman said."
24,CNN,"Some added sugar sources are worse than others for disease risk, study suggests",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/health/sugary-drinks-heart-disease-wellness/index.html,813,Madeline Holcombe,2024-12-10,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. What kind of sugary treat you are having might change its impact on your health, according to a new study. Sugary drinks were associated with a greater risk of developing cardiovascular health disease than sweets like baked goods, said lead study author Suzanne Janzi, a doctoral student in nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, via email. The study, published Monday in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, surveyed nearly 70,000 Swedish men and women about their diet and lifestyle between 1997 and 2009. Their incidences of cardiovascular disease –– including strokes, heart attacks and heart failures–– were collected from the national health registers through 2019, according to the study. Researchers looked at sugar consumption in three categories: sugary beverages, sweets like pastries, and toppings like honey or sugar added to tea or coffee, according to the study. Consuming sweet drinks (all sodas and fruit drinks that were not pure fruit juices) was associated with a higher risk of heart disease than those individuals who had more baked treats, but surprisingly those participants who consumed the least amount of sugar did not end up with the lowest risk of heart disease, Janzi said. It is important to note that the study was observational, meaning that while researchers found associations, they can’t say for sure that the ways people ate sugar caused the different rates of heart disease, Janzi said. They did adjust for other factors that might also influence the association, including age, sex, alcohol, smoking, exercise level and body mass index, or BMI, she added. But there may be others that they have not accounted for in their analysis. The results are also limited by the population studied, which is primarily of European descent, said Dr. Robert Eckel, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz medical campus and former president of the American Heart Association. Outside factors might be behind the association between low added sugar intake and increased cardiovascular risk, since there are no biological mechanisms to explain it, Janzi said. “One theory is that people with very low sugar intake might be replacing sugar with other unhealthy foods or nutrients,” she added. It could also be that those who limit their sugar consumption to extremely low levels are doing so for an existing health condition, or that they have very restrictive diets overall that do not provide all the important nutrients they need, Janzi said. She also points to a Swedish social tradition called “fika,” where people gather for coffee and pastries. “This practice is so ingrained in Swedish society that many workplaces have scheduled ‘fika breaks’ daily,” Janzi said. “It’s possible that the consumption of treats during these social interactions is strongly linked to social relationships, which have previously been linked to cardiovascular health.” The connection between low sugar and higher cardiovascular risk does need to be studied further, however, she said. There are some biological theories behind why sugary drinks are more associated with heart disease than pastries, Janzi said. “Liquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods,” she said. “Solid sugars are often part of foods that contain other nutrients like fiber, proteins, and fats.” Those nutrients slow digestion, meaning there is a more gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, Janzi said. While fats, fiber and proteins in solid food leave you feeling fuller longer, liquid sugars often don’t fill you up –– which can lead to appetite dysregulation and the consumption of too many calories, she added. “Different sources of added sugars also vary in their consumption patterns, which could further explain why they associate differently with cardiovascular disease risk,” Janzi added. The study suggests that you don’t need to cut out all sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease, Janzi said. “We all enjoy a dessert,” Eckel added. “Should we not have birthday cake and ice cream when your kids are having a birthday party?” But most Americans are probably consuming too much added sugar, and sweetened drinks are a good place to make reductions, he said. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day for women and 9 for men. A sustainable reduction might mean taking steps to reduce your sugar instead of going cold turkey. “Cut back by one serving per day until you’re down to one drink per day,” registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer said in a previous story. “Then aim for one every other day until you can phase out soft drinks entirely. “Alternate with seltzer/sparkling water can help you cut back,” she added. “Eventually you can replace soft drinks with seltzer or sparkling water if you are craving carbonation.”"

The 44-year-old, a Newport News native, made the announcement on his Facebook page on Tuesday. “It’s an honor to announce that I’ll be the new head coach of Norfolk State University… looking forward to coming back home,” he said in the post. Norfolk State has not officially announced Vick’s appointment. CNN has reached out to the school for comment. Since retiring from the NFL, Vick has never officially held any coaching position. In April 2018, he announced that he would be the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Legends in the Alliance of American Football (AAF), a new professional league. However, the team announced in February 2019 that he would not serve in that position and the league folded two months later during its inaugural season. Vick played 13 seasons in the NFL and helped to revolutionize the quarterback position with his dual-threat ability. He is statistically the greatest rushing QB of all time with 6,109 career yards on the ground, the most by any player at the position, though current Baltimore Ravens signal-caller Lamar Jackson is only 108 yards behind. He was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons as the No. 1 overall pick in 2001 and signed a 10-year, $130 million contract with the team in 2004, though his career was brought to a screeching halt in 2007 by the revelations of his involvement in an illegal dogfighting ring. He was suspended from the NFL indefinitely. In December 2007, Vick – who pleaded guilty to a federal charge – was sentenced to 23 months in prison. He subsequently pleaded guilty to state charges and received a suspended three-year sentence. In the summer of 2009, after serving 21 months in prison and two months of home confinement, Vick was reinstated to the NFL and sought a second chance to continue his career. The Philadelphia Eagles gave Vick that opportunity. He spent five seasons with the Eagles (2009-2013) before stints with the New York Jets (2014) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2015). He announced his retirement in 2017. Vick will be looking to turn around Norfolk State’s football program, which went 4-8 this season. The Spartans play in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the second-highest level of college football behind the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Norfolk State, a historically Black university (HBCU), is a member of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. "

The contest, which began in 2018 as ‘The Match’ when Tiger Woods faced off against Phil Mickelson, this time pitted the pairs from the rival circuits against each other over 18 holes in Las Vegas. The 18 holes were split into three sessions of six holes: four-ball, foursomes, and singles. It was a flying start for Scheffler and McIlroy, the world No. 1 and No. 3 respectively, who won the four-ball 3&2 after only four holes to take an early 1-0 lead. The foursomes were more of a contest, with Scheffler and McIlroy earning the win on the 12th hole, but DeChambeau and Koepka now needed to win both singles matchups to take the competition to a playoff. However, the third session was over on the 16th hole as the PGA pair cruised to a 3-0 victory. McIlroy told the TNT broadcast after the dominant victory: “We’re super happy to get the win. It’s a nice way to finish the year. Scottie and I got off to a pretty good start and then from there it was just about trying to keep the momentum.” “I don’t know a whole lot about crypto, but this is good enough motivation to do some research,” Scheffler joked as the duo received their prize. In the end, the 2024 edition of The Showdown wasn’t much of a contest with DeChambeau conceding afterwards, “It felt like it was a pillow fight from us.” Scheffler has enjoyed one of the most dominant seasons in golf history. The American won nine titles in 2024, including gold at the Paris Olympics, victory in the FedEx Cup, and the second Masters title of his career. In June, DeChambeau edged past McIlroy to win the US Open and claim his second career major. TNT Sports (formerly known as Turner Sports and briefly as Warner Bros.

28,CNN,Former Nazi bunker turned into hotel and leisure complex in Germany,https://www.cnn.com/travel/hamburg-bunker-anti-aircraft-flak-tower-germany/index.html,520,Maureen O'Hare,2024-08-14,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"At 58 meters tall - just a little taller than the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but with considerably more heft - the St. Pauli bunker in Hamburg, Germany, has dominated the city skyline for just over 80 years. Built using forced labor during Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, it’s a relic of the darkest period in Germany’s history - but this concrete hulk has had a surprising rebirth. The relaunched Hamburg Bunker is now packed with two restaurants, a five-story Hard Rock Hotel and a newly built pyramid-like rooftop bar and garden from which greenery flows abundantly over the concrete facade. The REVERB by Hard Rock is a fitting addition to a city with an impressive musical history – this is, after all, where The Beatles began their career at the start of the 1960s. The Karoviertel neighborhood in which the fortress-like bunker sits is a cool enclave filled with stylish coffee shops and vintage stores, plus the Knust nightclub in a repurposed abattoir. Rooms in the 134-key REVERB range from 180 euros for a classic room, with amenities including a 55-inch flat screen TV and Alexa in-room assistant, to 269 euros for a suite with sweeping citywide views. The hotel also has the kind of modern details you’d expect in any self-respecting hip hotel, such as self check-in, smart technology and co-working spaces. You don’t have to be a hotel guest to enjoy the bunker’s amenities, however. On the ground level, there’s the Constant Grind coffee shop and bar, and a Rock Shop for those seeking Hard Rock merch. Bar-restaurant Karo & Paul, by German TV chef Frank Rosin, opened as a bar in April 2024 and occupies the first three levels of the building. The restaurant area is still coming soon. The restaurant La Sala – Spanish for living room - is open for business on the fifth floor, offering lofty views and an international menu. Finally at the top is the Green Beanie roof garden, with bar and walkway looping round the building, which can be accessed by the public for free. The Hamburg bunker was one of eight flak towers – above-ground anti-aircraft bunkers which doubled as air raid shelters - which Germany built after British air raids on Berlin in 1940. The history the Hamburg Bunker wears is heavy, but a 76,000-tonne concrete behemoth with walls 2.5 meters thick can’t be easily demolished or ignored. The only flak tower to have been completely destroyed is one at Berlin’s zoo, as the others are in heavily populated areas where the explosives involved would be too great a risk, AFP reports. “The idea of raising the height of the building with greenery was to add something peaceful and positive to this massive block left over from the Nazi dictatorship,” Anita Engels, from the Hilldegarden neighborhood association which supported the project, told AFP. The association has helped with this new chapter in the Hamburg flak tower’s history by collecting testimonies from people who lived in the wartime bunker as well as records of the hundreds of forced laborers who built it. An exhibition on the first floor now tells the full story of the building’s history."
29,CNN,20 of the world’s best soups,https://www.cnn.com/travel/the-worlds-best-soups-wellness/index.html,1970,Jen Rose Smith,2024-11-17,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay. If a steaming bowl of soup strikes you as the ultimate in old-fashioned comfort, you’ve got plenty of company. Soup is one of the world’s oldest and most universal foods, said Janet Clarkson, author of the book “Soup: A Global History.” “Every culture has some kind of soup,” she said. “It’s got very ancient roots.” Early people simmered it in everything from turtle shells to lengths of bamboo, she writes in the book, turning out metal soup pots starting in the Bronze Age. Boiling food made it possible to subsist on stable grains, with herbs and other ingredients added for nourishment or medicinal purposes. Each time you deliver a pot of hearty soup (with perhaps a side of bread) to a friend with the sniffles, Clarkson said you’re in fact carrying on an age-old tradition. “Separating food and medicine — that’s not how ancient people thought of it,” she said. “I think in every country in the world, historically, some soups were seen as restorative.” That’s true no matter what you call it. Today, soup leans brothy while stews are more substantial, but the world’s spoonable foods have never fit neatly into the two English-language categories. While Clarkson dove into centuries of etymology to trace the history of soup, potage and broth, she settled on a generously broad take. “Just some stuff cooked in water,” she wrote, “with the flavored water becoming a crucial part of the dish.” It’s a definition that leaves room for the world’s tremendous culinary diversity. These are CNN Travel’s nominations for 20 of the best soups around the world: Fruits from the oil palm tree lend both fat and flavor to this soup from the Niger Delta, which also features fresh catfish, beef and dried seafood. It’s so popular that packets of ready-mixed banga spice are sold in shops. Most blends include African nutmeg, castor seed, orima, jansa and beletete leaves. These spices infuse a rich, red sauce that’s the soup’s main draw: Soak it up with eba or a ball of starch, two Nigerian staples made from cassava but prepared with different methods. Broth is simmered for hours with cinnamon, star anise and other warm spices to create a wonderfully aromatic base for this rice noodle soup. Pho is among Vietnam’s most recognized culinary exports, but the soup is a relatively new food, wrote Andrea Nguyen, author of “The Pho Cookbook.” And while today’s pho restaurants serve a wide range of flavors, beef is the original. By 1930, Nguyen explained, the soup was served with slices of raw beef cooked gently in the broth. Today, beef pho remains the most beloved version in Vietnam, with options that include the original raw beef, a mix of raw and cooked beef, brisket and tendon. Chunks of tender beets swim in brilliant red broth for a soup that’s beloved in Ukraine and across Eastern Europe. Often topped with a rich dollop of sour cream, borscht is anything but basic beet soup. It gets a tangy kick from kvass, a lacto-fermented beet juice that’s another regional specialty. And while the soup is sometimes attributed to Russian cuisine, that claim is contested. In 2022, UNESCO declared that borscht in Ukraine “unites people of all ages, genders and backgrounds at the table” and placed the soup on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. And individual Ukrainian chefs are doing their part to make the soup a symbol of the nation. A fisherman’s stew turned culinary icon, bouillabaisse distills classic Mediterranean flavors into a dish synonymous with the coastal city of Marseille. Saffron, olive oil, fennel, garlic and tomatoes blend with fish fresh from the sea. At one time, that fish would reflect each day’s catch, but things have gotten a bit stricter. According to signatories of the 1980 Bouillabaisse Charter — a collective attempt by local chefs to ensure the quality of the French soup — the most authentic recipe must include at least four kinds of seafood chosen from a list that includes monkfish and crab. Thinly sliced greens meld with potatoes and onions in this homey soup from Portugal’s wine-producing Minho region. Now, the soup is a culinary star from upscale cafes to rural kitchens, the definition of down-home comfort food. In many versions, tender Portuguese chouriço sausage adds an undercurrent of smoky, salty flavor that makes the soup even heartier. Enjoy alongside a glass of Minho’s famed vinho verde wine. Durum wheat harvested while green, called freekeh, adds satisfying heft and nourishment to this North African soup, which is especially beloved during the holy time of Ramadan. The tender grains absorb a tomato broth and aromatic spices, their flavor melding with chickpeas plus stewed chicken, beef, mutton or lamb. Serve with lemon wedges and a hunk of kesra bread. This creamy shrimp chowder is a specialty of Arequipa, a historic city surrounded by towering volcanoes. Cold nights in the mountains are perfect for the hearty dish: Tender shrimp swim alongside chunks of Andean potatoes and corn. It’s got a kick, too. The addition of ají amarillo, a chili pepper with a lilting, fruity flavor, adds satisfying spice to balance out the rich and creamy ingredients. Maybe that explains the soup’s reputation as a powerful aphrodisiac. Summer in Andalusia brings searing weather, ideal for cooling down with a bowl of this chilled vegetable soup. Today’s most classic version includes tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and olive oil, with a handful of stale breadcrumbs added for body. Arabs brought the dish to the Iberian Peninsula centuries before Spaniards tasted tomatoes, a New World ingredient. The original was a blend of bread, garlic and olive oil, pounded in a mortar and seasoned with vinegar. As with so many culinary treats, groundnut soup ignores international boundaries: Meat, fish or chicken simmered into a thick peanut soup is pure comfort food in countries across West Africa. Versions range from Gambian domoda — the national dish — to a Nigerian take cooked with bitter, leafy greens. No matter the country, such soups and stews are creamy, rich and salty, a satisfying combination that often gets a fiery jolt from the addition of Scotch bonnet peppers. Cultures and flavors meld in a hearty soup that’s a star of Louisiana cuisine, influenced by West African, Native Choctaw and French cuisines. Versions made with seafood, chicken and sausage are among the most popular today, but there are myriad ways to make this Southern specialty. Ground, dried sassafras leaves — called filé and long harvested by the Choctaw people — give many gumbo recipes a distinctive spice. Some cooks thicken their soup with a cooked flour paste called roux, while others swear by sautéed slices of okra. Every possible version is on display each year at the World Champion Gumbo Cookoff in New Iberia, Louisiana, where cooks battle for some serious soup-master bragging rights. When the sun sets during the month of Ramadan, many Moroccans break their fasts with a hot bowl of this comforting chickpea stew. Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and pepper lend warming spice to the savory tomato broth, which soaks into tender chickpeas. It’s also widely enjoyed in Algeria. While vegetarian recipes are popular, the most classic version is simmered with tender chunks of lamb or other meat. It’s not just fasting fare for Muslims; some North African Jews also prepare harira to break the annual fast of Yom Kippur. Tart plum sauce called tkemali adds bright, zesty flavor to this traditional soup, which is one of Georgia’s most beloved dishes. It’s made with unripe plums, whose sour note balances the richness of fatty beef and ground walnuts cooked into the soup. The aromatic kick, though, comes from the spice mix khmeli suneli, a blend of coriander, savory, fenugreek, black pepper, marigold and more. Shaping — or pulling — la mian noodles by hand for this traditional soup is an art in itself. Artisans use a finely milled, high-gluten flour and alkaline powder to mix a stretchy dough, then pull and fold a single piece of dough to make enough noodles for a bowl of soup. Slip them into a bowl of beef broth for a world-class soup that includes tender beef, pale slices of radish, chili oil and fresh herbs. (At some shops, diners may even ask for noodles of a preferred thickness and shape.) Soup is what’s for breakfast in much of Myanmar, where sidewalk vendors and tea shops hawk steaming bowls of mohinga out of enormous vats. The soul of this noodle soup is the aromatic broth, which is simmered with herbs and thickened with toasted rice powder. Fish lends added richness, while the thin rice noodles are perfect for slurping. Mohinga is so beloved that it’s gone from breakfast dish to anytime snack, and each region has its own twist on the classic soup. Tripe simmered for hours in a piquant, garlicky broth is the ultimate Mexican hangover cure, but menudo goes far beyond morning-after remedies. It’s a favorite at weddings and big occasions, too, when an enormous pot of the traditional soup can feed dozens of guests. It’s sheer comfort food, with kernels of hominy that get fresh bite from a garnish of raw onions, chiles and cilantro. Choose from one of two main varieties: Menudo rojo turns a deep red from chiles in the broth, while Sonoran-style Menudo blanco is a milder alternative. Palm oil and tomatoes tint coconut broth a warm, orangey red in this specialty from the Bahia region of Brazil, where locals eat steaming bowls on even the hottest days. This soup’s real draw is sweet, tender shrimp floating in the broth, however. Traditionally, moqueca de camarão is cooked in a handmade pot made from black clay and the sap of mangrove trees, then brought to the table in the same authentic vessel. Chicken noodle soup may reach its culinary pinnacle in this piquant Indonesian dish. Spices such as fresh turmeric, star anise, cinnamon, lemongrass and lime leaves combine for deeply layered aroma and flavor, with the jammy yolks of soft-boiled eggs to add extra richness. Every part of Indonesia has a local twist, and the soup is also beloved in Singapore, Malaysia and in faraway Suriname in South America, where the recipe arrived with Javanese immigrants. Eat topped with fried shallots, fresh limes and a fiery scattering of sliced red chiles. Sweet, sour, spicy and salty, this soup’s magnificent broth is the ideal foil for sweet, tender shrimp. Aromatic ingredients include galangal, lemongrass and lime leaves, while slivers of bright red bird’s eye chilis add additional heat. Tom yum goong is just one of many varieties of tom yum soup in Thailand — this version comes enriched with fat prawns, and is a favorite with many diners. Long-simmered pork bones impart intense flavor to this classic ramen, whose broth is cloudy with marrow and fat. It’s a signature of Fukuoka Prefecture on the southerly island of Kyushu, but the rich soup is now served in ramen shops across the country (and world). While the indulgent broth is the star of tonkotsu ramen, a bowl isn’t complete without slices of pork belly and a tangle of noodles that are hard in the center. Eat with a pair of chopsticks and a flat-bottomed spoon, and don’t forget to slurp — it’s believed to enhance the flavor. Boiled rice or barley adds grainy sweetness to this creamy yogurt soup. It’s believed to ward off colds during winter; some Turkish hospitals even serve yogurt soup to recovering patients. A crumble of dried mint helps balance the yogurt’s slight tang. Serve with a pillowy round of fresh pita bread. Jen Rose Smith is a writer based in Vermont. Find her work at jenrosesmith.com, or follow her on Twitter @jenrosesmithvt."
30,CNN,"Doburoku: once illegal, this Japanese alcohol is making a comeback",https://www.cnn.com/travel/doboruku-alcohol-japan-comeback-intl-hnk/index.html,845,Jonathan DeLise,2024-10-27,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Japanese-produced whisky, nihonshu (sake), and beer are popular around the world. But one bar in Tokyo has been trying to reintroduce to locals and visitors alike a taste of doburoku, one of the oldest and most controversial drinks in Japanese history. Heiwa Doburoku Kabutocho Brewery is in the Nihombashi neighborhood in eastern Tokyo. During the Edo period (1603 - 1868), this area flourished with activity due to boats carrying shipments of sake. With that in mind, Heiwa Shuzou (Brewery), which since 1928 had been producing sake in Wakayama prefecture, chose to open this rare doburoku specialty bar in one of the city’s upscale neighborhoods. Before venturing into the bar to try a glass, here’s what to know about this historic, controversial tipple. The history of doburoku is as murky as the drink itself. Often considered to be the ancestor of today’s sake; it is no coincidence that the characters comprising the word, 濁酒, signify “cloudy,” or unrefined, liquor. To distinguish this type of turbid Japanese alcohol from that of the ubiquitous and transparent sake, there are two distinct if slightly misleading categories: seishu (清酒), or clear sake, and doburoku (濁酒). Consequently, sake and doburoku have one key difference in their respective productions. Typical sake calls for a yeast starter, called shubo, and adding three main ingredients – steamed rice, kouji (moldy rice fungus), and water – over a period of days. However, when making doburoku, they are all simultaneously placed in with the yeast starter, causing the resulting mixture to be comparatively overflowing with sugars. The sugars then start to break down the yeast, which halts fermentation much earlier on. Ultimately, what remains is a sweeter liquid with a much lower alcohol content, formally known as doburoku. For nearly as long as rice has been cultivated in Japan, doburoku has existed. It was the brew of choice for farmers and Shinto priests alike. With a relatively simple recipe – i.e., throwing everything into the proverbial crucible at once – doburoku was a common sight throughout the countryside. The open practice of homebrewing continued unabated for centuries. According to Utsunomiya Hitoshi, director of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association (JSS), in 1855 there were 459 doburoku producers in Edo (present-day Tokyo) alone. Yet, as a result of the end of the Edo period (1603 CE - 1868 CE), all feudal lords were forced to abandon their regional domains in the name of the centralized Meiji government, based out of the new capital Tokyo. Borne out of the 180-degree shift in governance came highly structured institutions, including an empowered and regimented tax-collecting body. Realizing that licensed breweries and distilleries were a vital source of income for the new government, measures to limit homebrewing began to take effect. Utsunomiya says that 1880 is when the quantity of homebrewed liquor started to be restricted, while in 1882 a licensing system was introduced. Then, in 1896, a liquor tax was imposed on all homebrewing, culminating in the complete prohibition of homebrewed liquors in 1899. In essence, all doburoku made from then on came to be called mitsuzoushu (密造酒), “secretly produced alcohol,” or moonshine. However, even during that prohibition, doburoku could still be found in Japan. Tellingly, Shinto shrines were able to carry on using the beverage for rituals. After World War II, due to a shortage of sake, the Korean beverage makgeolli, an unfiltered cousin of doburoku made of rice, wheat, malt, and water, was a popular alternative. In spite of the fact that homebrewing is still illegal, the Japanese government allowed for inns and restaurants in special deregulation zones, primarily in regions where economic growth had stagnated, to commercially sell doburoku in 2003. As of 2021, there are 193 establishments around the country authorized to sell doburoku. Opened in 2015, Tokyo’s Sake Hotaru was the first legal spot to offer doburoku in Japan’s capital. But bar owners only started selling it to the public in late 2016. Since then, more options have appeared. Most prominently, in June 2022, the previously mentioned Heiwa Doburoku Kabutocho Brewery opened a bar near Nihombashi. Norimasa Yamamoto, President of Heiwa Shuzo, estimates that half the bar’s visitors are from overseas. “We often receive questions about the difference between sake and doburoku, how many days it takes to make it, and how it’s produced,” he says of the bar patrons. In addition to doburoku, the brewery’s own sake and beer labels are available. However, keep in mind that if you want to order anything, the brewery does not accept cash. The flavor is intense, with samplers comparing it to both cheddar cheese and noni, a unique-tasting Polynesian fruit. And travelers unable to make it to Japan can sample doburoku closer to home. In Brooklyn, Kato Sake Works sells small amounts of the drink. However, owner Shinobu Kato says “the context doesn’t exist here,” as Americans are less likely to have heard of doburoku. “Apart from a few sake shops that are very familiar with and interested in our doburoku,” Kato says, “most of the sales are at the taproom for both bottle to go and drink by the glass.”"
31,VOX,"Hannah Kobayashi’s mysterious non-disappearance, explained",https://www.vox.com/culture/389788/hannah-kobayashi-ryan-kobayashi-what-happened-update,1737,Aja Romano,2024-12-11,Entertainment,NA,NA,"The Hawaii resident’s disappearance became a viral internet mystery. That may have made things worse. by  Aja Romano. Editor’s note, December 11, 3:15 pm ET: On December 11, Hannah Kobayashi’s family told TMZ they had been in contact with Hannah that day and confirmed that she is safe. The twists and turns in the ongoing story of Hannah Kobayashi, who went missing in Los Angeles last month after failing to get on her connecting flight to New York, have kept the public riveted for nearly a month.  But now, amid a family tragedy that includes the death of Kobayashi’s father by apparent suicide, police have determined Kobayashi might have walked away from her life voluntarily. Los Angeles police announced Monday that they’d reviewed surveillance video showing a woman they believed to be Kobayashi on November 12, the day her family reported her missing. Kobayashi, who is from Hawaii, had failed to complete a flight from her home state to New York City. The footage shows a woman who appears to be Kobayashi at a Los Angeles bus station, buying a ticket to the border. Police say she used her passport to make the purchase, then crossed over into Mexico from San Ysidro.  The investigation is the second high-profile missing persons case in recent weeks to take an unexpected turn after the person turned up seemingly unharmed. On November 11, the day before Kobayashi’s family reported her missing, a Wisconsin man resurfaced after being missing for months to admit that he had faked his own death in a dramatic kayaking incident in order to escape his life and start over in Eastern Europe. Los Angeles investigators felt that Kobayashi had likewise walked away from her own life and that, until she decided to resurface, there was little they could do.  “To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell stated during a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.” There are several alarming differences between the two cases, beginning with the sharp and sudden turn in Kobayashi’s trajectory. The 30-year-old Maui resident was a free spirit with a love of art, photography, and the outdoors before she boarded a flight to visit a relative on November 8. It was supposed to be her first trip to the New York City — something she’d had on her “bucket list” of places to see — and she had plans to see a Broadway show with a friend before traveling upstate.  She was sharing the flight with an ex-boyfriend, though they reportedly sat in different parts of the plane, and he doesn’t appear to have had anything to do with her disappearance. Kobayashi didn’t join him on their connecting flight out of LAX. Instead, she left the airport. Security footage caught her getting on the Metro headed toward downtown Los Angeles. After her family reported her missing, multiple people reported having seen her at The Grove shopping mall on November 9 and 10. Eagle-eyed web sleuths spotted her appearing on camera 31 seconds into a video shot at a LeBron James Nike event held there. Hannah even uploaded a photo from the event to her own Instagram — the last post she’s made there to date. During her days spent in the city, she sent a series of alarming texts to family and friends. One text spoke of “Deep Hackers” who “wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, & have had me on a mind fuck since Friday,” while another claimed she’d been “tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds. From someone I thought I loved.”  She also told family she’d missed her flight to New York but reportedly used language that family members thought didn’t sound like her. One such suspect text, containing odd endearments she didn’t typically use, said, “I’m just really scared love & the redwoods if calling me & I know I’m meant to be there, I’m being guided there, like you have before … I risk my freedom if this goes wrong for me hun.” Another spoke of her having “just finished a very intense spiritual awakening.” In one text, Kobayashi reportedly claimed that she was scared and afraid to go home.  “Even though she was in contact with us, she wasn’t in contact with us in her right mind,” her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told USA Today. “I just need to rest & I’ll think better,” one text to her mother, sent on November 11, reportedly read. “But it’s very complicated Matrix underworld shit.” It was one of her final communications to her family. Her final texts indicated she was returning to the airport and promised to keep her family posted. Although she did return to the airport, she ultimately only picked up her luggage, which she’d requested to have flown back from New York to LA. That evening, according to a Facebook post made by her family, she was spotted getting off the Metro near Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center). Her family claimed in the post that they’d seen footage of the sighting which indicated that Hannah “does not appear to be in good condition” and she is not alone. After November 11, her phone was turned off, and by the following week, Kobayashi had fallen off the grid — she’d stopped sending text updates, and family and friends fanned out across the city to search for her. We now know that she had already crossed the border into Mexico, but her family claimed they had only radio silence from LAPD about what, if anything, they had learned, leaving them to search for answers alone. After the family held a public rally on November 21, police finally got in touch with them, though it would still be another week before any answers arrived. In the middle of the family’s fear that she’d been abducted or trafficked, and amid enormous and growing public speculation about what happened to her, her father Ryan Kobayashi was searching for her.  On November 15, he told KHNL Hawaii News Now that he’d experienced a “lot of worrying, a lot of confusion. Everything is just a blur it seems, because I haven’t slept well since I’ve heard the news.” He went on to ask Hannah to get in touch with the police or with her family.  “There’s a lot of people out there that care and love you, Hannah,” he said. “If you can just get to somebody, whatever you can do … just let us know that you’re okay.” At some time around 4 am on November 24, Ryan Kobayashi died by suicide in Los Angeles.  “I’m going to continue to stay strong for you,” Hannah Kobayashi’s sister Sydni wrote on social media. “We’re going to find Hannah.” Despite indications that Kobayashi may have been suffering from a mental break or another form of mental illness, Pidgeon pushed back on this possibility. “She has no record on that,” she told NBC on November 15. “She is not on medication. Hannah’s someone that we can call and she’s going to call us back within an hour.”  Pidgeon further criticized the public speculation about Hannah’s disappearance for pushing her father to a breaking point. Conspiracy theories online abounded about what happened to her, everything from run-ins with the Twin Flames new-age cult to bad drug trips gone haywire. “If Ryan is looking at all this shit, imagine that weighing on him?” she told the New York Post, which had previously reported sensationalized details like Kobayashi having paid for a tarot reading while she was out and about in LA. In their announcement that they would be changing Kobayashi’s status to that of a “voluntary missing person,” the LAPD claimed that Kobayashi had evinced a desire to “step away from modern connectivity.” This included old social media posts she’d made where she seemed to want to “disconnect from her phone,” according to Missing Persons investigator Lt. Douglas Oldfield.  Still, the family continued to press for answers, vowing that the search for Hannah would continue. It won’t, however, be continuing as publicly as before. The burgeoning Facebook group “Help Us Find Hannah,” which grew to over 25,000 members, went private after the announcement on Monday, with family members reportedly claiming to have received “threats against their lives and the lives of their small children.” It’s unclear what if anything provoked the threats, but it is clear that public speculation and scrutiny surrounding Kobayashi’s disappearance had spiraled in the weeks since she first left LAX. On Tuesday, moderators of Reddit’s r/Hawaii subreddit locked their post about the disappearance because it was “starting to see a lot of baseless conspiracy theories.” However complicated Kobayashi’s story is, it seems abundantly clear that her family is right to be alarmed for her safety. It’s also increasingly evident that while the era of social media and heightened public scrutiny over police investigations can be uniquely beneficial, it can also be extremely overwhelming, obfuscatory, and frustrating to family, friends, and officials trying to find loved ones. While the huge number of eyes on Hannah as she went on her journey was undoubtedly helpful in locating her, false sightings and far-fetched rumors may have made it harder on the family. Hannah Kobayashi’s situation, however alarming, was and is potentially resolvable. It’s impossible to know whether the tragedy of her father’s suicide could have been avoided if her disappearance hadn’t become headline-grabbing news, but it almost certainly didn’t help. Still, while it’s tempting to blame Ryan Kobayashi’s death on the media and public frenzy, the real stressors might have been much closer to home. He had told CNN that he and Hannah had not been close when she was growing up and that they “hadn’t had contact for a while.”  “I’m just trying to make up,” he said. “I’m trying to get her back. That’s my main focus.” The grim but less complicated takeaway from this series of tragic events might be just this: The mighty apparatus of true crime theorizing and crowdsourced web sleuthing can often make family tragedies into labyrinthine mysteries when they aren’t. Sometimes, the answers may be undramatic and unsatisfying — but perhaps the simpler they are, the less they lead us astray.  "
32,VOX,Jay-Z was named in a Diddy lawsuit. Will other celebrities be next?,https://www.vox.com/culture/390327/jay-z-diddy-rape-lawsuit-fbi-sex-trafficking,1143,Kyndall Cunningham,2024-12-09,Entertainment,NA,NA,"There’s likely more industry-shifting fallout to come from the Diddy case. by  Kyndall Cunningham One question that’s loomed over the disturbing allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs is the culpability of his famous friends. Will anyone else be exposed during his upcoming trial or named in the growing pile of civil lawsuits against him? In the months since the hip-hop mogul was federally charged with sex trafficking and racketeering in the Southern District of New York, spectators online have been mining old photos of Combs’s star-studded white parties, looking at potential celebrities — from Ashton Kutcher to Beyoncé — that could have been involved or at least possibly aware of his alleged “freak-offs.” This focus on Combs’s high-profile associates seems to have built on the speculation around the late financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose 2019 death left many open questions about his own elite circle. Online, conspiracy theories circulate about who knew or did what with the Diddy case, from QAnon-esque readings of Justin Bieber lyrics to anti-gay speculation about his mentorship of Usher. However, recent accusations involving one of Diddy’s most illustrious music peers have lent some gravity to this conjecture. On Monday, in an anonymous civil lawsuit, fellow rapper and mogul Jay-Z (a.k.a. Shawn Carter) was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000 along with Combs. The complaint, which was filed in October, initially only listed Combs as a defendant, concealing the names of a male celebrity who allegedly participated in the assault and a female celebrity who allegedly witnessed it. However, some back-and-forth between Carter and the accuser’s counsel resulted in the rapper’s inclusion in a re-filing, making Carter the first high-profile defendant intertwined in Combs’s ongoing legal scandals.  While it’s still early days for this case, the suit raises questions about what this will mean for the rest of Combs’s legal proceedings, and whether other A-list figures could possibly be named. Notably, Hollywood’s Me Too movement did not penetrate the even less regulated music industry in a culture-shifting way, let alone the male-dominated genre of rap. Will the calling out of a celebrity as gigantic as Jay-Z embolden more victims to speak up?  In the new lawsuit, posted by legal journalist Meghann Cuniff, the anonymous plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, claims that Combs and Carter took turns raping her at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party while an unidentified female celebrity watched. The accuser says she was transported to the party by Combs’s driver, who she met outside of Radio City Music Hall while she was trying to gain entry into the venue for the awards show. The driver told her he would take her to the party after the show, stating that she “fit what Diddy was looking for.” When they arrived at the mansion where the party was held, the woman said she signed what she thought was a nondisclosure agreement. She was also given a drink that made her feel “woozy and lightheaded, making her need to lie down,” according to the lawsuit. Shortly after she went into a room to rest, Combs and Carter entered. Combs allegedly grabbed her and exclaimed, “You are ready to party!”  According to the lawsuit, Carter took off her clothes, held her down, and raped her while Combs and the unidentified female celebrity watched. Combs then allegedly raped the plaintiff while Carter and the unnamed celebrity looked on. Eventually, the plaintiff was able to escape after hitting Combs in his neck and running out of the room.  Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who in recent months filed numerous lawsuits against Combs accusing him of physical and sexual assault, says in the latest lawsuit that he sent Carter a demand letter prior to refiling, “requesting a mediation” to resolve the matter. Carter then filed his own anonymous lawsuit against the plaintiff’s legal team, accusing them of extortion. In the refiled complaint, Buzbee calls Carter’s lawsuit “frivolous” and accuses him of “orchestrating a conspiracy of harassment, bullying, and intimidation against Plaintiff’s lawyers, their families, and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff” from naming him.  After the refiling, Carter denied all allegations, releasing an impassioned — and seemingly unvetted by a publicist — statement on his entertainment company Roc Nation’s social media accounts on Sunday. (The statement is currently being circulated as an ad on X.) In his response, he calls the initial demand letter he received from Buzbee a “blackmail attempt,” disparages Buzbee’s reputation as a lawyer, and mentions the effect of the accusations on his family, which includes his wife, singer Beyoncé Knowles-Carter: “My only heartbreak is for my family. My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people.” He also implores Buzbee to file a criminal complaint rather than a civil one. On Monday, Carter’s attorneys opposed the plaintiff’s request to proceed anonymously. The motion notes that in two previous cases that Buzbee filed in the New York district, the court denied his requests, after “failing to meet the burden to show that each plaintiff was entitled to ‘the exceptional remedy of anonymity.’”  While the world waits for a conclusion to this disturbing lawsuit, the implications of the news are yet to be seen. Will the exposure of someone as powerful as Carter result in more celebrities being outed in Combs’s legal proceedings or even sued on their own? Or is this simply the outcome of confidential back-and-forth handled in a messy manner? In a previous interview with Vox about the rise of high-profile sex-trafficking cases, former Department of Justice prosecutor Neama Rahmani said it’s unlikely that more would be exposed in the criminal charges against Combs, given that US Attorney Damian Williams lacks “a kitchen-sink approach” to prosecuting. He also said the “standard is higher” in criminal court, and prosecutors aren’t going to risk naming someone unless they’re certain they can get a conviction. However, he does expect for celebrities involved in these cases to receive civil lawsuits, as we’re seeing currently.  “There’s a lot of allegations that there were other celebrities that participated in these ‘freak-offs,’” says Rahmani, who has prosecuted human trafficking cases. “According to Cassie Ventura, he recorded these freak-offs both for his sexual pleasure but also to have power over the [celebrity] participants to blackmail them. So this might be the first domino to fall.”  Rahmani also tells Vox that other lawsuits against Carter could emerge, similar to the way Casandra “Cassie” Ventura’s 2023 claims against Combs, her ex-partner, led to an avalanche of allegations by other accusers. For now, Rahmani says spectators will have to wait and see. “It’s really impossible to know,” he says. “But it might be a Me Too-type of situation for the music industry.”"
33,VOX,8 million turkeys will be thrown in the trash this Thanksgiving,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/388106/thanksgiving-turkey-food-waste-sides-dry-bland,1479,Marina Bolotnikova,2024-11-27,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"We don’t have to accept all that death and waste for a dry, flavorless bird no one likes. by  Marina Bolotnikova. On Thursday, tens of millions of Americans will partake in a national ritual many of us say we don’t especially enjoy or find meaning in. We will collectively eat more than 40 million turkeys — factory farmed and heavily engineered animals that bear scant resemblance to the wild birds that have been apocryphally written into the Thanksgiving story. (The first Thanksgiving probably didn’t have turkey.) And we will do it all even though turkey meat is widely considered flavorless and unpalatable.  “It is, almost without fail, a dried-out, depressing hunk of sun-baked papier-mâché — a jaw-tiringly chewy, unsatisfying, and depressingly bland workout,” journalist Brian McManus wrote for Vice. “Deep down, we know this, but bury it beneath happy memories of Thanksgivings past.”  So what is essentially the national holiday of meat-eating revolves around an animal dish that no one really likes. That fact clashes with the widely accepted answer to the central question of why it’s so hard to convince everyone to ditch meat, or even to eat less of it: the taste, stupid.  Undoubtedly, that has something to do with it. But I think the real answer is a lot more complicated, and the tasteless Thanksgiving turkey explains why.  Sign up here for Future Perfect’s biweekly newsletter from Marina Bolotnikova and Kenny Torrella, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. Have questions or comments on this piece? Email me at marina@vox.com! Humans crave ritual, belonging, and a sense of being part of a larger story — aspirations that reach their apotheosis at the Thanksgiving table. We don’t want to be social deviants who boycott the central symbol of one of our most cherished national holidays, reminding everyone of the animal torture and environmental degradation that went into making it. What could be more human than to go along with it, dry meat and all?  Our instincts for conformity seem particularly strong around food, a social glue that binds us to one another and to our shared past. And although many of us today recognize there’s something very wrong with how our meat is produced, Thanksgiving of all occasions might seem like an ideal time to forget that for a day.  In my experience, plenty of people who are trying to cut back on meat say they eat vegetarian or vegan when cooking for themselves — but when they are guests at other people’s homes or celebrating a special occasion, they’ll eat whatever, to avoid offending their hosts or provoking awkward conversations about factory farming.  But this Thanksgiving, I want to invite you, reader, to flip this logic. If the social and cultural context of food shapes our tastes, even more than taste itself, then it is in precisely these settings that we should focus efforts to change American food customs for the better.  “It’s eating with others where we actually have an opportunity to influence broader change, to share plant-based recipes, spark discussion, and revamp traditions to make them more sustainable and compassionate,” Natalie Levin, a board member at PEAK Animal Sanctuary in Indiana and an acquaintance of mine from vegan Twitter, told me. Hundreds of years ago, a turkey on Thanksgiving might have represented abundance and good tidings — a too-rare thing in those days, and therefore something to be grateful for. Today, it’s hard to see it as anything but a symbol of our profligacy and unrestrained cruelty against nonhuman animals. On a day meant to embody the best of humanity, and a vision for a more perfect world, surely we can come up with better symbols.  Besides, we don’t even like turkey. We should skip it this year.  In 2023, my colleague Kenny Torrella published a wrenching investigation into conditions in the US turkey industry. He wrote:  The Broad Breasted White turkey, which accounts for 99 out of every 100 grocery store turkeys, has been bred to emphasize — you guessed it — the breast, one of the more valuable parts of the bird. These birds grow twice as fast and become nearly twice as big as they did in the 1960s. Being so top-heavy, combined with other health issues caused by rapid growth and the unsanitary factory farming environment, can make it difficult for them to walk. Another problem arises from their giant breasts: The males get so big that they can’t mount the hens, so they must be bred artificially. Author Jim Mason detailed this practice in his book The Ethics of What We Eat, co-authored with philosopher Peter Singer. Mason took a job with the turkey giant Butterball to research the book, where, he wrote, he had to hold male turkeys while another worker stimulated them to extract their semen into a syringe using a vacuum pump. Once the syringe was full, it was taken to the henhouse, where Mason would pin hens chest-down while another worker inserted the contents of the syringe into the hen using an air compressor. Workers at the farm had to do this to one hen every 12 seconds for 10 hours a day. It was “the hardest, fastest, dirtiest, most disgusting, worst-paid work” he had ever done, Mason wrote. In the wild, turkeys live in “smallish groups of a dozen or so, and they know each other, they relate to each other as individuals,” Singer, author of the new book Consider the Turkey, said on a recent episode of the Simple Heart podcast. “The turkeys sold on Thanksgiving never see their mothers, they never go and forage for food… They’re pretty traumatized, I’d say, by having thousands of strange birds around who they can’t get to know as individuals,” packed together in crowded sheds.  From birth to death, the life of a factory-farmed turkey is one punctuated by rote violence, including mutilations to their beaks, their toes, and snoods, a grueling trip to the slaughterhouse, and a killing process where they’re roughly grabbed and prodded, shackled upside down, and sent down a fast-moving conveyor belt of killing. “If they’re lucky, they get stunned and then the knife cuts their throat,” Singer said. “If they’re not so lucky, they miss the stunner and the knife cuts their throat while they’re fully conscious.”  On Thanksgiving, Americans throw the equivalent of about 8 million of these turkeys in the trash, according to an estimate by ReFED, a nonprofit that works to reduce food waste. And this year will be the third Thanksgiving in a row celebrated amid an out-of-control bird flu outbreak, in which tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on infected farms have been culled using stomach-churning extermination methods.  When I search for the language for this grim state of affairs, I can only describe it in religious terms, as a kind of desecration — of our planet’s abundance, of our humanity, of life itself. On every other day of the year, it’s obscene enough. On a holiday that’s supposed to represent our gratitude for the Earth’s blessings, you can understand why Thanksgiving, for many vegetarians or vegans, is often described as the most alienating day of the year.  I count myself among that group, although I don’t dread Thanksgiving. I’ve come to love it as a holiday ripe for creative reinvention. I usually spend it making a feast of plant-based dishes (known by most people as “sides,” though there’s no reason they can’t be the main event).  To name a few: a creamy lentil-stuffed squash, cashew lentil bake, a bright autumnal brussels sprout salad, roasted red cabbage with walnuts and feta (sub with dairy-free cheese), mushroom clam-less chowder (I add lots of white beans), challah for bread rolls, a pumpkin miso tart more complex and interesting than any Thanksgiving pie you’ve had, and rasmalai, a Bengali dessert whose flavors align beautifully with the holidays.  Vegan turkey roasts are totally optional, though many of them have gotten very good in recent years — I love the Gardein breaded roast and Field Roast hazelnut and cranberry. You can also make your own.  The hardest part of going meatless is not about the food (if it were, it might not be so hard to convince Americans to abandon parched roast turkey). “It’s about unpleasant truths and ethical disagreements being brought out into the open,” Levin said, about confronting the bizarre dissonance in celebrations of joy and giving carved from mass-produced violence.  These conversations are not easy, but they are worth having. And we don’t have to fear losing the rituals that define us as Americans. To the contrary, culture is a continuous conversation we have with each other about our shared values — and any culture that’s not changing is dead. There’s far more meaning to be had, I’ve found, in adapting traditions that are no longer authentic to our ethics and violate our integrity. We can start on Thanksgiving."
34,VOX,How not to poison your loved ones during your big holiday feast,https://www.vox.com/even-better/388293/safety-holiday-turkey-thanksgiving-christmas-food-kitchen,1661,"Keren Landman, MD",2024-11-27,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Kitchen do’s and don’ts that may surprise you. by  Keren Landman, MD Not to brag, but I’m pretty good in the kitchen; I love a complex pastry project, ferment things with relish (sorry), and am probably above-average at emulsifying a sauce. But there is one scenario involving cooking for others that strikes dread in my heart: getting them sick. I’m a doctor with specialty medical training in infectious diseases and public health. If I prepared a meal that sent a crowd of my friends and loved ones running for the bathroom, I might never emerge from the shame hole. I thought I knew everything I needed to know about food safety to avoid eternal public humiliation. Still, as I came to understand while researching this story, even know-it-alls like me have a lot to learn about handwashing, cleaning surfaces and food, storing leftovers, and reducing non-germ risks. Thanksgiving, and the holidays more broadly, are different from other times of the year. People are preparing more dishes for more people than they typically would, says Ben Chapman, a food safety expert who leads the Agricultural and Human Sciences at North Carolina State University. The resulting chaos means less control in the kitchen — which often leads to higher risk for both cooks and eaters.  Here’s the stuff you need to sweat — and don’t — as you take on your next big holiday dinner. DO wash your hands – a lot. Raw whole turkeys are highly likely to be contaminated with germs that can make people sick, most commonly campylobacter and salmonella. The big risk of touching raw meat in the kitchen is that you’ll move those germs to surfaces that other people will also be touching a lot. That raises the chance people will get nasties on their hands — and in their mouths — even if they didn’t directly handle the thawing turkey. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. For that reason, Chapman recommends washing your hands more than you think you need to when preparing a meal for a lot of people. Clean your hands immediately after touching raw meat — and don’t forget that even a partially thawed turkey can transmit germs.  Plain soap and water works fine — it doesn’t have to be antimicrobial soap to do the job, but you do need to rub the skin all over the hands to get them really clean, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under the nails. But the real shocker here, at least to me, was when Chapman told me alcohol-based hand sanitizers are actually better for most situations, even if you have watery turkey juice on your mitts. (One situation where sanitizer is inferior to soap: after touching lots of really fatty meat, like sausage or pork. In those situations, use soap to make sure you’re cutting through the grease to get at all the germs mixed in.) DON’T skip drying ’em. It’s not just the actual handwashing that’s important for removing germs from your fingers, Chapman says: Drying hands after washing removes up to 90 percent of the bacteria on the skin’s surface, so don’t ignore this important step. “I might go through 10 dish towels on Thanksgiving Day,” Chapman says. There’s no need to waste tons of paper towels drying off. Chapman suggests keeping different dish towels in different parts of the kitchen for different purposes, if at all possible. For example: You could keep one “dirty” towel in a kitchen corner for drying off hands you’ve washed them after say, holding a raw turkey. On a hook elsewhere in the kitchen, you could keep a “clean” towel you use for wiping up sauce spills or other less germy messes.  Any system can easily break down when random people drift in and out of your kitchen while you’re cooking. It’s not a bad idea to just chuck used dish towels directly in the wash after mopping up spills of raw meat juices or drying off particularly gross hands. “I might go through 10 dish towels on Thanksgiving Day,” Chapman says. DON’T worry about washing your produce. Washing produce removes physical debris, like soil, sand, and dirt. However, it rarely removes germs that make people sick. The reason: When produce is contaminated with pathogens, they often attach just under the surface, within tiny pores in the fruit or vegetable that protect it from being washed away.  “Fresh produce, unfortunately for us, is our No. 1 source of foodborne illness in the US,” Chapman says. “And also unfortunately for us as consumers, by the time it gets to me, there’s very little I can do.” DO take special care if you’re going to wash your turkey. There’s no food safety reason to wash your turkey, but a lot of people like to anyway because of personal preference. Chapman prefers wiping debris off with a hand towel (which he then throws straight into the washing machine). However, if you opt to wash your turkey, he suggests being especially fastidious about cleaning your sink afterward. “The sink is a food preparation area,” Chapman says, as people often rinse lettuce or other vegetables in the sink, and water bouncing off a contaminated basin can splash pathogens onto food that does not later get cooked.  If you’re a poultry washer, just make sure to clean and sanitize the sink afterward, including the bottom, sides, and rim around the basin. So if you’re a poultry washer, just make sure to clean and sanitize the sink afterward, including the bottom, sides, and rim around the basin. DO frequently sanitize your kitchen counters and other surfaces. Because turkey is particularly high-risk for contamination with disease-causing germs, Chapman is “bleach forward” about sanitizing his kitchen’s surfaces on Thanksgiving, and he favors a pre-packaged bleach spray (like the ones made by Clorox or Lysol) for getting the job done. If you’re really worried about damaging clothes, “that’s part of the reason why aprons exist,” he says. However, you can also use sanitizers that contain quaternary ammonium, which is in most non-bleach disinfectant sprays. As a bonus, it’s also easier on stainless steel and utensils — and alcohol-based cleaners are also quite good.  Just don’t mix different cleaners together or spray them on the same surface at the same time, as doing so can release toxic gases that can cause serious illnesses or even death. Whatever you choose, stick with it — at least for the day. DO cook your turkey (and whatever’s inside it) to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Turkey and everything inside it should be heated to at least 165 degrees before serving to kill any disease-causing germs. It’s fine to cook stuffing on the inside as long as it reaches this temperature. Yes, doing this without turning out a dry turkey requires some finessing; Chapman roasts his stuffed bird at a lower temperature of 325 for a longer time and also strategically deploys foil.  DO keep your fridge cold enough. The right refrigerator temperature is cool enough to slow spoilage, but not so cold it freezes milk, lettuce, and other foods high in water content. Chapman sets his to 38 degrees, which he says keeps leftovers good for about a week. He suggests buying a cheap refrigerator thermometer to ensure yours has the perfect climate if it doesn’t have a built-in one you can calibrate.  DON’T bother cooling leftovers before refrigeration. The old rule about bringing leftovers to room temperature before putting them in the fridge is from a time of older refrigerators, when they occasionally allowed interior temperatures to rise above safe levels for food storage. Modern refrigerators don’t work that way, so feel free to put leftovers in the fridge while they’re still warm, Chapman says.  DON’T bother reheating leftovers, unless you want to. So long as food was cooked to the appropriate temperature at the time of your feast and was not left out on the counter for hours before refrigeration, there’s no need to reheat leftovers to any particular temperature. DO choose non-nonstick cookware and wood, silicone, or stainless steel cooking utensils. The best bet for cookware is to use products made of glass, stainless or carbon steel, or cast iron. That’s because a lot of nonstick cookware is made with “forever chemicals,” the shorthand term for per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) that have been linked with a range of cancers and other health conditions. Teflon is one of them, but there are other PFASes out there, and manufacturers aren’t always transparent about which of the broad panoply of these chemicals are or aren’t in their products. If you love nonstick cookware, a good bet is to use a pan with a ceramic coating. And if you end up using a nonstick pan coated either with Teflon or another PFAS, you can minimize the release of these chemicals by using only soft (e.g., non-metal) utensils when cooking, avoid heating it while empty, and wash them by hand using gentle cleansers and sponges. And for stirring whatever’s in your pot, it’s a better idea to use wood, silicone, or stainless steel rather than black plastic utensils. There’s a chance — albeit a small one — these may be made from recycled electronic waste, so avoid them if you’re risk-averse. DO ventilate and filter your air while cooking — especially with gas. Gas stoves create a lot of pollutants, which is why they typically must be installed with range hoods. Other kinds of cooking can also create pollutants — for example, cooking with nonstick pans, grilling, and frying.  Unfortunately, range hoods don’t always vent the air outdoors — sometimes, they just recirculate it inside. So if you’re cooking with gas, it’s a great idea to open a window and turn on a fan if you have those options, and a portable air purifier can also help. A little knowledge can go a long way toward maximizing what makes hosting fun and minimizing the worry your feast will lead to a lifetime of dishonor. Go forth and feed your people!"
35,VOX,Drug overdose deaths have declined. No one knows why.,https://www.vox.com/health/390840/drug-overdose-deaths-decline-fentanyl-opioids,1141,Haleema Shah,2024-12-12,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Here are three possible explanations. by  Haleema Shah In 2022, the US reached a grim peak in drug overdose deaths: Nearly 108,000 people died that year, more than twice the number who died in 2015, and more than four times the number in 2002.  Now, in what experts hope is more than a blip, the overdose epidemic that has affected every state in the nation might be showing some signs of abating.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s preliminary data on the 12-month period ending in June showed that overdoses dropped about 15 percentage points from the previous period. There were still roughly 94,000 overdose deaths, signaling that the public health crisis is far from over, though a positive change could be on the horizon.  Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Sign up here. America’s overdose crisis was exacerbated decades ago by the increasing use of and addiction to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, that have proliferated through the nation’s drug supply.  Fentanyl was first produced in the 1960s and prescribed by doctors to people seeking relief from severe pain, such as cancer patients. A cheaper, more potent cousin of heroin, the drug soon became a favored commodity of traffickers, who began cutting other drugs with fentanyl and drawing people addicted to prescription painkillers such as oxycodone that have become increasingly more difficult to access. As my colleague German Lopez wrote in 2017, fentanyl made America’s opioid crisis — already the deadliest drug crisis in US history — even deadlier. So what might have turned the trend around? In the latest episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, we asked Lev Facher, a reporter covering addiction at STAT News.  “There’s no one event that happened about a year and a half ago that would explain this sudden significant decrease in drug overdose deaths,” says Facher. “While there’s a lot of optimism in the harm reduction and addiction medicine and recovery world, it’s cautious optimism because people don’t really know what’s happening.” Despite that, Facher says, experts and advocates do have a few potential explanations:  The simplest explanation for the drop in overdoses could be the nature of the drugs themselves; they simply may have become less toxic and less potent. Last month, DEA administrator Anne Milgram suggested that the agency’s crackdowns were having a direct impact on the drug supply.  “The cartels have reduced the amount of fentanyl they put into pills because of the pressure we are putting on them,” she said at the National Family Summit on Fentanyl, which gathers people who’ve had loved ones die from drug use. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data can’t give us the full picture of the effectiveness of cartel crackdowns, but it shows that the rate of fentanyl confiscation at the border is hardly consistent. In January, CBP confiscated 1.3 million doses of the drug. The number of confiscations dropped significantly in June before rising back to about 1.3 million doses again in August. And data on the potency of illicit drugs is limited, given that drug-tracking systems vary from one community to another, Facher told Vox.  “The places that do have really good drug checking, there have been some changes detected in terms of the drugs people are using, but nothing that would explain this sudden drop,” he said. Another explanation could be that harm-reduction efforts are working. Access to naloxone, the lifesaving, overdose-reversing drug, expanded significantly in cities across the United States in the last few years. Local governments such as Los Angeles County made the drug available at schools, churches, libraries, and jails, and everyday Americans are increasingly encouraged to carry naloxone.  Harm-reduction campaigns may have also had an impact on those who use recreational “party” drugs, who might favor stimulants but could find themselves unknowingly ingesting fentanyl if a dealer has mixed it into cocaine or MDMA. Drug testing kits like Overdrive are available for less than $15 from retailers like Amazon and provide people with step-by-step directions on testing drugs for fentanyl.  Data also suggests that the way people consume drugs might reduce the likelihood of death by overdose. Smoking fentanyl is becoming increasingly more popular than injecting it, and the former is linked to fewer fatal overdoses and blood-borne infections. The third explanation, floated by some epidemiologists, is the most bleak, and suggests that after hundreds of thousands of people were killed by drug overdoses in a relatively short time span, the epidemic is essentially burning itself out.  “It’s a concept called the ‘depletion of susceptibles,’” Facher said. “And that’s just to say that so many people have already died of drug overdoses that there aren’t as many drug users left to die. That’s not necessarily a mainstream theory. And even if it were accepted, it probably wouldn’t explain the full significant sudden decrease in drug deaths.” The staggering number of deaths from the opioid epidemic, however, could be a contributing factor to declining youth drug misuse. An analysis from KFF showed a small drop in opioid misuse among high school students from 2017 to 2023. As Maia Szalavitz writes for the New York Times, “Drug epidemics are often cyclical. Younger generations witness the harm specific drugs have caused their older siblings or parents, leading them to avoid those substances.” The latest data on overdose deaths comes amid a pivotal presidential transition. While the addiction crisis is a marquee issue for both Republicans and Democrats, the incoming Trump administration includes high-level officials who’ve been intimately impacted by it.  The vice president-elect, JD Vance, has spoken extensively about how opioid addiction affected his mother and his community of Middletown, Ohio. Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is in addiction recovery himself and his policy proposals include a network of “wellness farms” to serve as treatment facilities. It remains to be seen whether the administration will focus its efforts on addiction recovery or if it will devote more attention to law enforcement and the US-Mexico border.  “There is trepidation about a potential shift toward law enforcement and away from treatment,” Facher said. “Most of my sources talk about harm reduction, treatment prevention, and really just keeping people alive [by] meeting them where they are and getting them the services they need to live healthier lives as the cornerstone of ending this drug crisis.” "

One of the quickest ways to kill a conversation, for example, is to start telling someone about that strange dream you had. Perhaps an even more surefire way to land on the far side of that threshold is to tell them about your trip on one of the most bizarre, powerful, and under-studied psychedelic drugs: DMT, or, if you speak chemistry, N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tales of hyperdimensional worlds populated by various intelligent creatures — tiny machine elves eager to teach you the universe’s secrets or giant praying mantises that seem to harvest human emotions — are commonplace in DMT trip reports.  Because these trips are so bizarre, even compared to other psychedelics, DMT has largely lived on the fringes of the ongoing revival in psychedelic research and therapy.

That’s slowly starting to change. “We unashamedly think there’s value here, beyond the weird stuff,” neuroscientist Chris Timmermann, who leads the DMT Research Group at Imperial College London, told me. Like its more conventional psychedelic counterparts, DMT could play a role in psychedelic therapy, offering a new treatment for conditions ranging from depression to cluster headaches — and it could even serve as a kind of rocket fuel for the science of consciousness.  The compound naturally occurs in a variety of mammals and plants. “DMT is everywhere,” wrote chemist Alexander Shulgin, who created nearly 200 psychedelics through the late 20th century. Humans have been ingesting a slow-acting form of it for at least a few hundred, and perhaps thousands of years by boiling DMT-containing vines and leaves to make the psychoactive brew ayahuasca. But scientists didn’t figure out how to isolate, extract, and ingest pure DMT on its own until 1956, which branched the drug off from ayahuasca into its own history. On high doses of DMT, the self does not disappear. Instead, the self feels largely intact, but transported to alternate worlds reconstructed out of the chaos.  If Timothy Leary was the “high priest of LSD” in the 1960s, the eccentric philosopher Terrence McKenna became DMT’s rhapsodic bard a generation later. “My entire expectation of the nature of the world was just being shredded in front of me,” McKenna recalled of his first trip. “All this stuff was just so weird and so alien and so un-English-able that it was a complete shock — I mean, the literal turning inside out of my intellectual universe.” Like other psychedelics, DMT was pushed underground when President Richard Nixon outlawed it in 1970. Well before today’s psychedelic renaissance, it was research on DMT’s hallucinogenic effects led by psychiatrist Rick Strassman in the early 1990s that marked the first return of legal psychedelic research. In the decades since, other psychedelics have claimed the spotlight, but in the last few years, DMT research has shown hints of a resurgence. The drug’s unique properties may make it both a more convenient therapy and a more powerful tool for studying the mind than its trippy counterparts: While psilocybin or LSD trips run for several hours, a DMT trip winds down after just 20 minutes, and unlike with other psychedelics, users don’t build up a tolerance to DMT that diminishes its impact. DMT’s propensity to construct rich alternate realities in the minds of its users can also help push the study of consciousness into new terrain. The drug puts the mind’s ability to create immersive, convincing models of the world on full display — the very same thing our minds do during ordinary consciousness (and dreams). And if DMT can simulate that process in a quick and controllable way, then studying the mechanics of DMT trips could help us learn more about the construction of our sober minds, too.  Still, even with all the world’s research funding and best scientific minds, we may never be able to truly “explain” what happens under the influence of this peculiar molecule — but there’s certainly more to know than we do now. So to the woefully incomplete degree that’s currently possible, here’s the news on DMT as we know it today, in not-quite-all of its curious and under-studied glory. Pure DMT was first synthesized in 1931 but was set aside, leaving its effects unknown. It wasn’t until 1956 that the first straight DMT hit was reported. Hungarian pharmacologist Stephen Szára had wanted to study LSD, but upon requesting some from the Swiss Sandoz Laboratories, which had been supplying to psychiatrists in the 1950s, he was denied. Communist governments scared them enough, but communists with acid? That was too risky. No matter, thought Szára. He pored over the existing psychedelic literature, found research identifying DMT as an active ingredient in longstanding psychedelic drinks of the Amazon, extracted it from the Mimosa hostilis plant, and became the first person to describe what happens when you take a hit. From his Budapest laboratory, Szára reported “brilliantly coloured oriental motifs and, later, wonderful scenes altering very rapidly.” Immediately after, he recruited volunteers from his hospital to try the strange drug. In these first DMT trials throughout the late 1950s, participants reported rooms “full of spirits” and “curious objects.” “DMT is the most efficient reality-switching molecule currently known to exist” Rumors of the immensely powerful, conveniently short-lasting psychedelic began to spread through the 1960s counterculture (famously, they were pretty into mind-altering drugs). By 1962, word of DMT reached Timothy Leary, who was then researching psychedelics at Harvard. He ran experiments that applied his idea of carefully crafting the “set and setting” of a trip — focusing on how everything from a room’s lighting to one’s preexisting cultural ideals shape the psychedelic experience — to DMT. Though Leary’s experiments successfully nudged them toward increasingly positive experiences, DMT trips remained indelibly weird and never rose to the level of LSD among the counterculture’s preferred vehicles for exploring altered states of consciousness. When it was outlawed under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, the modest interest that remained was largely put on ice. The freeze lasted until the early 1990s, when Strassman managed to jump through the heap of regulatory hoops to carry out legal DMT research at the University of New Mexico, making DMT the origin of today’s revival in psychedelic science. He went on to publish a book in 2000 that dubbed DMT “the spirit molecule,” which was later adapted into one of the most-viewed documentaries on Netflix, starring podcaster Joe Rogan.  Still, DMT remained concentrated more on podcasts and internet forums than in the medical and therapeutic highways toward mainstream acceptance like MDMA and psilocybin. High-profile psychedelics research — like much of neuroscientist Roland Griffiths’s work at Johns Hopkins or studies funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — has tended to focus on psilocybin or MDMA. By 2019, the world’s first dedicated academic center for psychedelic science opened at Imperial College London, where Timmermann was finishing up his PhD on the neuroscience of DMT. After advising a few PhD students also working on DMT, he figured, “Let’s make this into a group and focus our energies into understanding [DMT] from a consciousness perspective,” launching the university’s DMT Research Group in 2022. Now, Timmermann said, “there’s definitely traction here. And the way to develop that is by doing good science.”  Now, the fun stuff. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore, author of a forthcoming book on the history and science of DMT, Death by Astonishment, has called it “the most efficient reality-switching molecule currently known to exist, almost instantaneously transporting the tripper from the Consensus Reality Space to a bizarre hyperdimensional omniverse teeming with superintelligent entities of every (un)imaginable form and character.” We’ll get to all that, but let’s move slowly. Recreationally, most people smoke DMT either from a pipe or, especially nowadays, a vape pen. The effects kick in within a few seconds, before you can even exhale the first hit. All psychedelic experiences are dose dependent — a gram and a half of dried mushrooms might as well be a different drug than 5 grams — and with DMT in particular, ascending doses lead not just to more intense experiences, but to different kinds altogether. There’s no agreed upon “map” of what psychonauts (self-experimenters who explore altered states of consciousness) call the “DMT space.” Different people slice it up in different ways, with varying degrees of detail. Some taxonomies have six levels, with names like “The Magic Eye Level” and “The Waiting Room.” Others have mapped out four-step ladders. For brevity’s sake, I’m going to zoom out as much as possible and cram the weirdness of DMT trips into three simple categories: low, medium, and high doses.  At low doses, the onset of DMT feels similar to other psychedelics. Colors grow more vivid, your body may tingle, the world appears a bit crisper, as though the contrast and saturation have been dialed up. A portentous, ambient sense of meaning begins to set in, what’s been called the “noetic quality” of psychedelic trips. Have questions, comments, or ideas? Email me: oshan.jarow@voxmedia.com. At medium doses, that vivid picture of the world begins to dissolve into classically psychedelic imagery: swirling geometric patterns, flashing colors and shapes, and a general deconstruction of ordinary perception into chaos. Your ordinary sense of self, too, while not obliterated or dissolved, will likely begin to lose its familiar anchors in space and time. Then there are high, or “breakthrough,” doses (around 20–30 milligrams and up), where the distinctly DMT-flavored weird stuff starts to happen. The incoherent imagery of a medium dose snaps into a new kind of coherence, reconstructing a very high-definition world, albeit one that looks entirely different from what we’re familiar with. When people talk about exploring other dimensions on DMT, it’s this dose they’re talking about. “If the dose is sufficient … the user bursts through a kind of membrane into an entirely novel domain unlike anything within this universe,” as Gallimore put it. “The most striking feature of this ‘DMT space’ is its structure, often described as ‘hyperdimensional.’” In our normal states of consciousness, human perception tends to see space as flat, even though, ever since Einstein’s theory of relativity, we’ve known that mass bends space and time. Some consciousness researchers believe that on high doses of DMT, perception takes on this kind of curvy geometry. That could help explain why the experiences are so strikingly unusual, and why it’s so hard to describe them back in our sober minds.  But since DMT trips only last a few minutes, people often feel that they’re pulled out of the oddly curved DMT worlds right as they begin to find their bearings, or, as we should probably now get into, before they can finish their conversations with the entities. One of the strangest things about these breakthrough doses are the entities. “I was neither intellectually nor emotionally prepared for the frequency with which contact with beings occurred in our studies, nor the often utterly bizarre nature of these experiences,” Strassman wrote of his DMT experiments in the ’90s.  Not everyone meets entities on DMT, but it happens often enough that it seems like more than a random quirk. A 2022 analysis of 10 years worth of trip reports posted on the r/DMT subreddit, totalling 3,778 DMT experiences, 45.5 percent included “entity encounters,” including: deities, aliens, “creature-based entities” like reptilian and insect beings, mythological beings, “machine elves,” and “jesters.”  While McKenna, who succeeded Leary as the voice of the psychedelic counterculture, is often credited with spreading the idea and expectation of encountering “self-transforming machine elves” in DMT space, humans have been encountering other seemingly intelligent beings while under the influence of DMT since well before he had his first trip in 1965. One of the hallmarks of ayahuasca is encountering other spirits and beings, so much so that ayahuasca is often personified as “Mother Aya.” Even among the early pure DMT users in Szára’s experiments in the 1950s, people reported seeing “strange creatures, dwarfs or something.” A young physician recalled that “The whole room is filled with spirits.” Another stated, “In front of me are two quiet, sunlit Gods … I think they are welcoming me into this new world.” A whole scientific literature is emerging to document the different kinds of entities people meet in DMT spaces. (And outside of peer review, there’s a debate over whether these entities and alternate dimensions are “real.” Gallimore, for example, has argued for conducting diplomacy with the DMT entities, since we can’t rule out their existence.)  Either way, the full-on construction of novel worlds and beings gives scientists an opportunity to study the mind in the midst of one of its most dazzling abilities: creating worlds of experience. “You can track the brain as it’s dissolving the habitual model of the world and generating a novel one that has equal or even deeper feelings of immersion,” Timmerman told me. DMT, along with the other classical psychedelics — psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline — share a primary mechanism of action, binding to the serotonin 2A receptor and scrambling activity across both the brain’s default-mode and salience networks (brain regions responsible for self-referential thinking and helping our brains choose what information is worth paying attention to). DMT also binds to the sigma-1 receptor, which a team of Hungarian researchers recently found helps protect brain cells when they lack oxygen, as in a stroke. At least one neuroscientist thinks that could help explain the whole entities thing. Also like other classical psychedelics, DMT is neither physiologically addictive (though any drug carries abuse potential) nor toxic to the brain (per that sigma-1 research, it could actually be neuroprotective). Still, DMT experiences can be destabilizing. One of the main risks is sometimes called “ontological shock,” where someone’s worldview is undermined in a way that causes lasting distress. One survey of 2,561 DMT users found that more than half who identified as atheists before their DMT trips no longer identified as atheist afterward. There’s nothing wrong with abandoning atheism per se, but upending worldviews should always be handled with care, caution, and available support. That said, upending worldviews in reliable, controlled, and targeted ways could also help advance our understanding of how minds construct worldviews in the first place.  So far, though, psychedelics haven’t quite lived up to their promise of revolutionizing the science of consciousness. “The big limitation on the use of psychedelics to understand the mind and brain concerns how difficult it is to isolate components of the psychedelic experience that we’re interested in,” said Timmermann. His hope is that short trips associated with DMT, which can be repeated in quick succession without diminishing in intensity, will prove more easily interpretable to scientists working in lab settings. For example, DMT research is already turning up a curious pattern that hasn’t emerged with other psychedelics.  One of the major findings in psychedelic science has been that the entropy — or randomness, complexity, and disorder — of brain activity is a kind of signature of a trip’s intensity. Stronger trips are associated with higher levels of entropy in the brain, all the way to reports of “ego dissolution,” dubbed the “entropic brain” hypothesis by neuroscientist Robin Carhart-Harris. Most psychedelics push our minds from order to disorder.  A 2006 study found that two months after taking psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, two-thirds out of 30 volunteers rated their trip as one of the five most meaningful experiences of their lives. Read Vox’s reporting on the science of how psychedelics crank up the dial of meaningful experiences here. DMT fits this mold, up to a point. Low to medium doses show a reduction in the alpha frequency of brain waves (which correspond to relaxed and wakeful states), along with rising entropy, a signature finding of sober brains sinking deeper into a trip. But in high doses of DMT, that trend flips. The self does not disappear. Instead, the self feels largely intact, but transported to alternate worlds reconstructed out of the chaos. The rising entropy gives way to new neural signatures of order. “We’re starting to see the emergence of low-frequency brain waves in the breakthrough state, usually called delta or theta waves,” Timmermann said. “What’s intriguing about them is that these brain waves are very much present when people are asleep and dreaming. And there’s a resonance between dreams and the DMT state, the deconstruction of the assumptions about external waking life and the reconstruction of a novel world of experience.” These “contractions” in brain entropy, as Timmermann called them, tend to happen when his team asks tripping study participants to pay attention to a single, salient feature of their experience, like an entity. “Our perceptual systems are finding a way to make sense out of this chaos,” he said.  Researchers hope that probing how DMT deconstructs and reconstructs our experiences of the world can make at least some progress on psychedelic science’s original promise of a major leap in our understanding of consciousness. “Our scientists are interested in how world-modeling actually comes about, and whether something like DMT can simulate that for us,” said Timmermann. That, in turn, can help us understand “how we generate a model of the world in our habitual, daily lives.”  Next year, Timmermann’s research group is moving to University College London, where they’ll add DMT’s molecular relative, 5-MeO-DMT (bufo), to their research agenda, which, I kid you not, is considered even stronger than DMT. If DMT can help scientists study how brains model worlds, bufo can show what happens when the brain stops modeling everything altogether and a bare form of consciousness without content remains. “5-MeO-DMT is like the modeler of no-worlds … it’s like a canvas without the paint on it. If we can have that experience, then you can look into the more fundamental, core workings of the mind and brain,” said Timmermann. Together, DMT and bufo could make for a hell of a one-two punch in the future of consciousness science. Another mystery sets DMT apart from just about every other psychedelic: It’s naturally produced by the human body, and no one knows why.  Research published in 2019 led by a team at the University of Michigan found that some parts of the mammalian brain can have similar levels of DMT as they do serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates a huge variety of important functions, from behavior and mood to memory. When trace amounts of naturally occurring DMT were first found in humans in 1965, scientists speculated that it may underlie mental illness, like schizophrenia. Further research found that DMT might actually mitigate symptoms of psychosis, which tanked that idea pretty quickly. Next, in 1976, it was proposed that DMT might be a neurotransmitter, akin to serotonin and dopamine, that has a functional role in the body. Serotonin is popularly associated with happiness, dopamine with motivation and pleasure — but what the heck would DMT be doing in the neurochemistry of our minds? A 2022 review of the last 60 years of debate over DMT’s function concluded that DMT is likely doing something in the brain. But in the two years since, new research has turned up more questions than answers.  It’s tempting to speculate. When Strassman called DMT “the spirit molecule,” he meant it rather literally: Its function in the brain, he argued, is simply to elicit psychological states that we call spiritual. Research published in 2019 showed that levels of DMT in rat brains spike during cardiac arrest, lending some substance to a link between DMT and near-death experiences.  But neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin, lead author of that study and considered one of the world’s leading experts on the puzzle of DMT in the human body, put it bluntly: “We know nothing — seriously! — about the role of endogenous DMT.” For all the far-out ridiculousness of DMT — the curvy geometry, the mischievous but generally benevolent elves, the prospect of hidden dimensions — it could have remarkably practical applications. Studies are beginning to corroborate anecdotes, for example, that DMT could treat cluster headaches, one of the most painful conditions known to humankind.  DMT could also offer a few advantages over the current generation of psychedelic therapy treatments that rely on MDMA or psilocybin. The big one is money: Psychedelic therapy is incredibly expensive. A few months of MDMA therapy recently tested in clinical trials cost about $11,537 per patient, nearly half of which came from paying two therapists to stay with each patient for a full eight hours during the MDMA sessions. DMT, since it winds down within 20 minutes, could make for much more affordable treatments. Gallimore and Strassman have proposed the possibility of extending DMT trips via a steady IV drip, keeping levels of DMT in the body elevated and stable much like we do with anesthesia during surgery. Last year, researchers from Imperial College London kept 11 healthy volunteers in the DMT space for an extended period of 30 minutes, demonstrating for the first time that “extended DMT,” or DMTx, works and that the length and intensity of DMT therapy sessions could be customized to patient preferences.  “When we speak about precision psychiatry and how to treat individuals according to their specific profiles and needs, a plastic and dynamic psychedelic experience could make things cheaper and more effective,” said Timmermann. DMT has already shown promising results for depression, and clinical trials are underway — and patents being filed — for DMT as an injectable treatment.  Extended DMT would be exciting news on the consciousness science front, too. The longer people can stay in the strange worlds of DMT space, the more access that gives scientists and psychonauts alike to one of the mind’s most fascinating tricks: constructing worlds of experience. And even though these worlds may be so alien that many of us might be tempted to write them off, there’s no explanation for our universe, no matter how sober, that isn’t unfathomably weird, as philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel writes in his book, The Weirdness of the World. There’s only “a complex blossoming of bizarre possibilities,” where “something radically contrary to common sense must be true about the fundamental structures of the mind and the world.” Given how DMT seems to shred just about every bit of common sense, perhaps it’ll help turn up some answers.  Whether that happens may depend on efforts to rein DMT in from the fringes of psychedelia. Given its ubiquity in nature, there’s plenty to go around. And given its presence in our bodies, we all stand to gain from a better understanding of what it’s doing there and why taking more of it leads to what remains perhaps the most bizarre kinds of experiences humans have yet encountered."
37,VOX,Skip the airport. It’s time to plan the perfect road trip.,https://www.vox.com/life/363970/road-trip-planning-tips-car-maintenance-snacks-google-maps,1605,Allie Volpe,2024-08-04,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Five tips to ensure you have a seamless adventure on the open road. by  Allie Volpe Somewhere between San Luis Obispo and Monterey, California, I wondered if the rain would ever cease. Pounding storms had followed me on my two-week solo road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, so much so that the Pacific Coast Highway was closed to motorists through Big Sur — one of my planned pit stops. While I meticulously planned the drive and itinerary down to the hour, I never once considered a backup plan for something as common as a closed road. At a loss for what to do, I scrambled to find an Airbnb in a remote area for the night. I had unintentionally broken one of the top road trip rules, according to seasoned roadtripper and blogger Lori Blalock. “Having a plan B and C is a good idea,” she says.  For nearly as long as cars have been on the road, Americans have practiced the art of the road trip. In the 1910s and ’20s, motorists drove from cities to more remote areas to set up camp beside their cars. After World War II, road trips were the family vacation of choice, with many visiting national parks and extended family in other cities. The humble road trip has been immortalized in countless movies over the years including National Lampoon’s Vacation, Lost in America, and Little Miss Sunshine. Hesitant to travel by plane during the pandemic, many Americans opted to adventure by car. The love for the open road hasn’t let up in post-pandemic years either: A recent poll found that 73 percent of Americans preferred to drive to their vacation destination instead of flying. While road trips allow travelers to avoid the hassle and expense of air travel, there are plenty of considerations roadtrippers should keep in mind. From planning a practical route to keeping the peace with your travel companions, road trip experts offer their best advice for planning a vacation on wheels. Blalock’s road trip planning begins first with a timeframe and then a list of sites and stops she wants to see — not the other way around. “A lot of people reverse that,” she says. “People know where they want to go, but then they don’t quite have the time, and then they end up having road trip failures, because where they want to go just does not fit into their timeframe.” Map out your route based on the time you have and then determine your must-see sights and attractions, whether it’s a national park or a brewery. Estimate how long you’ll spend at each destination — be generous — to avoid rushing from one place to the next. Have an idea of what you might do instead if a trailhead is closed because of bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances. If you only have three days earmarked to get from point A to point B and back, you don’t want to feel overwhelmed racing from one roadside attraction to the other. The trip should be just as much about the journey as the destination.  When planning itineraries for clients, Sam Highley, CEO and founder of road trip travel company All Roads North, focuses on the “in-between places”: off-the-beaten-path towns, restaurants, and parks. The routes themselves are on scenic backroads rather than highways.  Don’t overlook lesser-known landmarks. “National parks are treasures in the US and they form a big part of our itineraries,” Highley says. “But I think there’s also a ton of other state parks, public land wilderness areas, that can be equally as beautiful and rewarding and you’re likely to be there with a tenth of the people that you might experience in a national park.” Google Maps: Get directions and save locations of interest. AAA TripTik: Map out gas stations, attractions, restaurants, and camping sites along your route. The app even suggests locations to stop for breaks. AAA Gas Cost Calculator: Plug in your starting location, destination, and car make and model and get an estimate of how much gas will cost. Waze: Get directions and live traffic updates. Roadtrippers: Search for and add stops like restaurants, shopping, and music venues, to your route. GasBuddy: Locate the cheapest gas prices near you. ChargePoint: Locate electric vehicle charging stations near you. Spotify/Apple Music: Make collaborative playlists with passengers or queue up podcasts. If you need some inspiration for in-between places, check out tourism board websites for the various towns and cities you’ll be passing through, suggests Danielle Desir Corbett, the host of the podcasts Road Trip Ready and The Thought Card. She also discovers unique pitstop destinations from travel blogs, vlogs, and Instagram posts. As you’re planning, save Instagram posts to road trip inspiration folders or make Pinterest boards to organize your research, Desir Corbett says.  Book your tickets and accommodation for popular locations ahead of time, such as camping at tourist-heavy national parks or Instagram-famous motels, Blalock says. As soon as you know which towns you want to spend the night in, book a hotel, Desir Corbett says. Similarly, secure tickets for can’t-miss museums, cooking classes, pick-your-own produce, and other experiences early. “It’s not something that you have to necessarily do months and months in advance,” Desir Corbett says. “It could be the week you’re planning everything out.” Leave room for spontaneity, too, Desir Corbett says. If you see a billboard for an interesting museum or farmers market while you’re driving, don’t be afraid to check it out. These unplanned excursions are part of the magic of road trips. When you stop for gas at welcome centers or rest stops, pick up pamphlets for local tourist attractions. Ask bartenders, employees at the front desk of hotels, or other locals you encounter for their recommendations, Desir Corbett says. “You could either fit it during this trip or just have it back in your back pocket for your next adventure,” she says. A perfectly planned itinerary is only as good as the car getting you there. A few weeks before you depart, take your car in for a regular maintenance check, says AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz. That way, you won’t be delayed if your car needs a repair that might take a few days. Make sure your tire pressure, car battery, oil levels, and windshield wipers are in working order. Try to fill up your gas tank or charge your car the night before you leave home and each subsequent night of the trip. Aside from the clothes and other necessities you plan on bringing with you, there are a number of things you should have in your car to keep comfortable or in case of a breakdown. Diaz suggests having jumper cables, a flashlight, wet wipes or baby wipes, and a first aid kit on hand. Depending on the time of year, you might want to keep blankets or personal fans around. Have multiple chargers for your phone, tablet, or other devices in case you lose one or more than one person needs to charge up at a time. Blalock recommends packing a portable tire inflator and a kit for repairing a flat tire.  Desir Corbett and Highley suggest packing a cooler stocked with easy-to-eat, nonperishable meals, like sandwiches, yogurt pouches, granola bars, nuts, popcorn, and water — items that won’t melt or make a mess. Desir Corbett recommends bananas, grapes, cheese, and crackers for kid roadtrippers since they’re not too sugary or sticky. While you may be motivated to barrel through an eight-hour drive, experts suggest taking a break or switching out drivers every two hours or so. “Drowsy driving, just like distracted driving, is a problem and can be very dangerous,” Diaz says. Try to depart in the morning on each day of your trip to maximize daylight driving. Either find a rest stop, fast food spot, or an interesting attraction to take a break and stretch your legs. If you have kids with you, expect to stop more frequently, Desir Corbett says. Try to find a park or a rest stop with a playground so they can burn off energy. And always keep your phone away and on do not disturb while you’re driving.  If you’re traveling with kids, you’ll want to make sure they’re comfortable and entertained. In Desir Corbett’s experience traveling with a toddler, limited-mess snacks and drinks are a must, as is entertainment. “We’re not afraid to pull out our iPad, and we have some holders in the back of our car,” she says. “We may put on one of his favorite shows. We also try to put on his favorite music.” Make sure any devices are fully charged (and you have backup chargers handy) and download movies or shows in case you lose service. Diaz recommends playing games with kids, like imagining where the other cars on the road are heading. “Try to get their imagination going and engage with them,” she says. As for the adults in the car, Blalock likes to assign roles to passengers to help keep the peace. Knowing who is in charge of navigation, music, snacks, and driving holds everyone accountable. Let passengers have some time to themselves if need be. For example, Blalock says her daughter occasionally pops in headphones and listens to her own music during their road trips. Keeping the car clean and organized can prevent fights, Blalock says. Have a bag for trash and organizational bins for other essentials, like camping supplies, food, and hygiene products.  Regardless of who you’re traveling with, road trips can be the perfect opportunity to choose your own adventure and uncover offbeat treasures along the way. Just make sure to do your homework first."
38,VOX,Traveling has never been better if you’re rich — but it’s worse if you’re not,https://www.vox.com/money/361362/summer-travel-budget-cost-luxury,1756,Whizy Kim,2024-07-19,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Looking at the growing rift in travel spending. by  Whizy Kim For a long time, the wealthy had the market cornered on leisure. A well-off person in the 18th and 19th centuries might go for a horse ride in the park or take a Grand Tour through Europe; in the Gilded Age, they might go away to a socialite’s weeklong house party in Newport in the dog days of summer. Meanwhile the working class, well, worked. It’s only in relatively recent decades that a vast world of affordable relaxation and entertainment opened up to people of all classes, whether that meant going out to eat or taking a trip — which became more accessible as commercial flights got a lot cheaper in the late 1970s. Only in the mid to late 20th century did the idea of a family summer vacation become a symbol of the good life that the American middle class could enjoy. That’s still true, but something has changed in the last few years. The budget vacation is a crappier experience than it used to be. As with everything else in an inflationary economy, it’s more expensive to travel now than it was in 2019. But it’s not just about higher prices; there’s a growing divide in how the haves and have-nots jet around — maybe in part because more affluent travelers are increasingly willing to shell out extra money for maximum comfort. Today, if you have money to throw around on vacation, you’re spoiled for choices that unlock shorter wait times or better, roomier plane seats. Meanwhile, if you’re on a tight budget, your vacation is likely to feel especially overpriced for how shabby the experience is. Whether or not something has gotten “too expensive” is relative to a lot of factors — like how much money you personally have, how fast prices have risen, how much value the product or service brings you, and even how much the cost of other things in the economy have gone up. The reality is that travel prices haven’t soared quite as much as other sectors — they’re up by about 10 percent since 2019, which is a lot lower than the inflation we’ve seen in, say, food prices. “General prices are up about 23 percent over that same time period,” says Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet, which has been tracking travel inflation since 2019. According to NerdWallet, flights are actually 6.3 percent cheaper than they were in June 2019. But other subcategories of travel have bounced up: Hotel prices are up 11.6 percent, rental car prices are up 33 percent, the price of entertainment experiences such as movies, theaters, and concerts are up 21.4 percent, and dining out is almost 30 percent higher.  One reason people may feel that travel prices are at all-time highs, according to French, may be because they’re still trying to book trips fairly last-minute — which was relatively cheap to do during the height of the pandemic, when demand was way down. It is not cheap to do that anymore. Another possibility is “recency bias,” says French. In early 2021, the average inflation-adjusted fare out of Atlanta, for example, was $298.52, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. As of early 2024, it was $417.79. Our set point for what a flight should cost might still be stuck in 2021.  Then there’s the bang-for-your-buck to consider. Base fares have fallen since 2019 — as in, what you might see before checking a bag — but more airlines have been adding bag fees as well as raising existing ones. These extras, called “ancillary fees,” have been making up an ever-larger share of airlines’ revenues, jumping way up around 2022 and last year amounting to nearly $118 billion globally, a record high for the industry.  “We are seeing a trend of what we call ‘unbundling airfares,’” says French. Low-cost (think Southwest, JetBlue) and ultra low-cost (Frontier, Spirit) airlines long ago unbundled everything in their fares in order to offer the cheapest, most spartan experience possible to travelers on a tight budget. Then they charged ancillary fees to a smaller portion of their passengers to make a profit. But since the late aughts, a growing number of full-service airlines — including all major US carriers except Southwest — have also unbundled what’s included in a basic plane ticket, blurring the distinction between full-service and low-cost carriers. In other words, fliers today are paying a slightly lower base fare for a worse flying experience compared to the bygone years when a full-service airline ticket included checked bags and seat selection — the travel industry’s version of skimpflation. Though airlines make a lot of money from extra fees, according to a recent YouGov survey, most consumers claim that they probably wouldn’t consider paying for any flight extras — the most tempting was choosing their own seat, the least was being in an “adult-only zone” on the plane. Only about 16 percent of US travelers said they would pay for extra baggage. It’s not just the experience of flying that feels lousier, either. Many hotel chains have reduced their daily housekeeping services, leading to grousing about cleanliness — a factor arguably more important to travelers post-pandemic. Hotel resort fees have become more common, too. The average price of booking an Airbnb has soared since 2019, including the cleaning fees that often come with a short-term rental. Listings without exorbitant cleaning fees might be saddled with a long list of chores guests should complete before they leave: loading the laundry, taking out the trash, putting fresh sheets on the bed — the stuff you take a vacation to get away from. Once you’ve arrived at your destination and are ready to see the sights, you’ll likely be paying more than travelers once did for tourist attractions. Disney World, for example, used to offer a service where all guests could skip the line at their favorite ride by making a reservation. Now doing so requires an extra purchase beyond your admission ticket. TSA PreCheck lines, which cost $78 for five years, are also getting longer, making it less valuable to pay for the skip-the-line service.  On the other hand, people with money to burn now have more opportunities than ever to be upsold. Maybe you can’t afford the first-class cabin, but what about premium economy? Or basic business? Or $100 per hour to rent a bed during a long-haul flight? Frontier lets you pay to keep the middle seat open. Why not pay the $500 annual fee on a credit card that will get you in the door of a new airport lounge, which in 2024 has become an inexplicably luxe space occupying tens of thousands of square feet? “What this shows is that travelers are willing to trade up,” says Henry Harteveldt, president of the travel industry market firm Atmosphere Research Group.  “We all know there’s no God in economy” If you have the money, why wouldn’t you? “We all know that coach sucks, we all know there’s no God in economy,” says Harteveldt. By stripping away services into disparate add-ons, airlines have ensured that basic economy is a dismal experience, which in turn makes it more likely for travelers with discretionary income to justify spending more for comfort and sanity. People are willing to spend more extravagantly than ever for luxury travel, too. Carl Junior, a senior luxury travel curator at Scenset, an agency that creates custom luxury travel itineraries for wealthy clients, says there’s been an uptick in the number of people interested in its service since the pandemic — particularly intergenerational families looking to take a big trip together. Such custom itineraries often range between $10,000 to $100,000, sometimes more. “They definitely are willing to spend a lot more just for that ease and comfort of travel,” Junior says. The pandemic shook up people’s priorities; those who can afford to want all-out, once-in-a-lifetime trips. Private jet travel has soared since the pandemic, and while cruises are in high demand overall right now, luxury cruises have seen an especially huge bump in bookings. High-end hotels are seeing faster revenue growth than mid-range and budget hotels; more are opening up to meet demand, which means luxury lodgings are making up a higher share of total available hotel rooms. Data from CoStar, a commercial real estate data company, shows that luxury hotel occupancy in 2024 was slightly higher than this time last year, while occupancy of budget hotels was 3.4 percent lower. Summer is the most popular time to travel, but in a recent Newsweek survey, nearly 45 percent of respondents said they’re not taking any trips this season, with about half of that group citing cost as the reason. The results echo other surveys showing that Americans are pulling back on travel spending. The profile of someone who does travel over the summer has become slightly more affluent, too: According to Deloitte, in 2023 about 31 percent of Americans who made a summer trip were people with an income under $50,000. In 2024, this group makes up just 19 percent of travelers. The average income of the leisure traveler today is about $95,000, according to research from Atmosphere. The average income of the budget airline traveler, in contrast, is $79,000 — which is higher than the $73,000 to $74,000 range it was a few years ago. “There definitely is a group of people who are not flying as much, or perhaps at all, because right now their budgets simply don’t allow them to do so,” says Harteveldt. Income has always been tied to the ability to travel. While most Americans have flown by air at least once in their life, college graduates — who typically earn a lot more money than people with a high school diploma — are vastly more likely to have visited multiple foreign countries. A Statista survey in 2015 showed that almost one-fifth of households earning more than $80,000 per year were frequent air travelers, while just 3 percent of those making less than $40,000 said the same. Around one-third of the lowest-income group said they had never flown, compared to just 7 percent of the highest-income group. Another 2017 survey showed that the majority of those making under $35,ooo had never taken an international vacation. Today, traveling well is available in more flavors and increments, but that also means there’s more of a chasm than ever between upgraded vacationers and those who can only afford the bare-bones fare, if that. The ceiling of travel experience is higher, and the floor is lower. There are few places that make class divides more apparent than the airport."

See our ethics statement. The second half of an election year can be a fraught one for books. Publishers tend to front-load their most interesting titles away from the election to try to keep them from being swallowed up by politics come the fall. After an election, books can feel too trivial and unserious to deserve our focus. The books I took the most from in the second half of 2024 are the ones that fought against that impulse, that insisted on their own importance. They were works that took their subjects and their language seriously, that demanded my focus and rewarded it with something bigger and more beautiful than I could come to on my own. I hope, in these strange and confusing months, that they can do the same for you. Book recommendations — both old and new — that are worth your time, from our critic Constance Grady. I’ve already chronicled the best books of the first half of the year here. (One of the below is actually from this January, but I didn’t get to it until now and it was so good that I didn’t want to keep it from you.) A number of them I first recommended in my monthly book recommendation newsletter Next Page. If you’d like to learn about the best books I’m reading early, subscribe here. Martyr!, the debut novel from poet Kaveh Akbar, is word-drunk and elegiac, an enormous pleasure to read. Just look at that exclamation point in the title: its ironic knowingness, its outrage, its euphoria. This is a book whose author has weighed every punctuation mark just that carefully. The inciting incident of Martyr! is a true one. In 1988, the US military shot an Iranian passenger plane out of the sky, mistakenly believing it to be a fighter jet. Akbar takes as his premise the idea of a man whose mother died on that flight, instantly “turned into dust” when the missile hit the plane: “clean in a way, if you didn’t think about it too much.” The motherless boy grows up to become Cyrus, a poet and a recovering addict searching aimlessly for purpose. What Cyrus cares about most is poetry, but he feels that language, rule-bound and limited, will never be able to touch his depression, “get rid of the big ball of rot inside me.” He tells his AA sponsor he wants to die, then tries to channel the impulse into a literary project about martyrs. Cyrus’s mother died because of an error the US never apologized for (“Actuarial,” Cyrus fumes, “not even tragic”), but a martyr can make their death bear meaning. Perhaps by studying them, Cyrus can give meaning to his own life. Martyr! is a messy book. Akbar has a poet’s unease with plot, and the coincidences that power his narrative forward never manage to feel elegant. Still, the dreams and poetry and warmth that lace the novel make a triumphant case: for life, and for art, and for beauty, which matter even when they shouldn’t.  The reign of Queen Elizabeth II was so long that contemplating it can feel, sometimes, like contemplating eternity. She came to the English throne in 1952, anointed by God, still expected to hand-pick her prime ministers and decide when to dissolve Parliament. At her death in 2022, Elizabeth was queen of a cosmopolitan liberal democracy with almost no real political powers left to her, but her remarkably strong aura of stateliness remained unshaken despite decades of familial royal scandal.  The reign of Queen Elizabeth II was so long that contemplating it can feel, sometimes, like contemplating eternity. In Q, Craig Brown makes Elizabeth the still, behatted center of a kaleidoscopically turning world, ever stoic and unchanging as the world powers forward without her. Brown’s trademark move is to write biographies in fragments, assembling them out of bits and pieces of other sources; he likes to go to the London Library and check the indexes of every memoir and biography in the place for mentions of his subjects. He’s got a chapter on every person who ever called Elizabeth “radiant” (including Sylvia Plath), all the surreal dreams people have about her (English novelist Kingsley Amis dreamed of trying to elope with her), all the inane things people have said in a panic when they have to make small talk with her (the author found himself expounding on the German playwright Bertolt Brecht).  Brown’s key insight is that Elizabeth was so determinedly unreadable that she became a mirror to her subjects, a figure on whom they so fervently projected their fears and aspirations that she ended up showing them themselves. What to make of a woman whose coronation was marked by active combat troops in Kenya firing shells filled with red, white, and blue smoke into battle? Or whose death inspired a supermarket chain to turn down the volume of the beeps on its cash registers? What, except: what strange impulses we find in our strange human selves.  Garth Greenwell is a hedonist of language. In previous books, his sentences have hummed the pleasures of the body, of sex, and of conversation and poetry. In Small Rain, Greenwell begins with pain — five days of it, so intense, the narrator tells us, it felt as though “someone had plunged a hand into my gut and grabbed hold and yanked.” Yet even here, in this novel about illness and suffering, Greenwell cannot abandon his palpable joy at sensory pleasures, at beauty. Greenwell’s narrator brings himself reluctantly to a hospital, still in the grip of early Covid in spring of 2020, after those five days of pain don’t seem to be abating. There, he occupies himself charting the power dynamics of the hospital staff and sending his partner out to bring him books of poetry. In the dream space of the hospital bed, where days follow the rhythms of tests and doctors’ rounds and meals, there are long stretches of unmarked time with which the narrator can do nothing but think. “The point was to perceive reality,” he thinks of poetry, “to see things that are only visible at a different speed, a different pitch of attention, the value of poems is tuning us to a different frequency of existence.” What to do about America in this moment when we are far past whatever we might imagine to be her golden age? So many of our old national myths have gone threadbare and shabby, increasingly revealed to be too flawed to sustain us now, or riddled with hidden cruelties, or always only beautiful lies. What stories can we tell about ourselves and each other now if we want to learn to move forward? One of the metaphors we sometimes turn to in these moments is King Arthur’s Camelot, which provided a romantic lens for processing the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. In Lev Grossman’s Arthurian novel The Bright Sword, Camelot feels like a match for our own post-Trumpian moment. It’s a Camelot after the death of King Arthur. All the higher powers and supernatural figures who used to take an interest in Camelot’s fate have turned their backs. All the quests are over. The only people left alive are the ones who never quite fit into the stories to begin with, the ones who were too poor or too queer or too feminine or too Black to become legends. How, Grossman’s characters seem to ask, are we supposed to figure out what to do next in this kind of story? The answers, when they come, are radiant, and they feel surprisingly true. Rachel Kushner’s cool-voiced ecothriller Creation Lake got a fascinatingly polarized reception when it came out this fall. Brandon Taylor at the London Review of Books said it was so bad he “wanted to weep”; Dwight Garner at the New York Times said that after the opening paragraphs, he knew he was “in the hands of a major writer, one who processes experience on a deep level.” Me, I think Creation Lake is a rich, messy, frustrating piece of work. It doesn’t always land, but when it does? Oh boy. Creation Lake tells the story of an American spy we know only by her alias, Sadie Smith. A Berkeley dropout, she’s been hired to infiltrate a group of radical environmentalists in rural France to see if they’re planning a terrorist action. Sadie goes about her job efficiently, but she doesn’t particularly care about the group, whose members she considers boring and hypocritical, or about the environment. Kushner handles the espionage part of the plot with an almost hostile disregard for such classic thriller elements as suspense or intrigue, but the whole book comes to life when we get to the part of the story Sadie (and, apparently, Kushner) actually cares about. Creation Lake is a rich, messy, frustrating piece of work. It doesn’t always land, but when it does? Oh boy. The environmentalists correspond with Bruno Lacomb, an esoteric philosopher who long ago renounced the excesses of human civilization to go live in a cave and think about Neanderthals. Periodically he emerges to use his daughter’s computer and write to his environmentalist friends, and Sadie, having hacked into their inbox, is entranced by his emails. Reading them, she winds across vast stretches of time, encountering alien and disenfranchised figures: the gentle and depressed Neanderthals of prehistory, whom Sadie imagines as 1950s greasers with Joan Crawford faces; the persecuted Cagot of medieval Europe, who Bruno provocatively suggests might have been descendants of Neanderthals; Bruno himself, a Jew who grew up in occupied France in World War II.  Sadie, who is so cynical in her interactions with the people she manipulates and uses, seems to long for Bruno’s letters to cohere into a grand unified theory that will tell her there is something worthwhile about being human, no matter how destructive human civilization may have been. She searches his emails for redemption — and he doesn’t, in the end, disappoint her. The women’s hotel was an institution of the first half of the 20th century: a place for ambitious young women and virtuous spinsters who were modern enough to try to make something of themselves in a big city, but modest enough (either of character or of means) to want to do it in a chaperoned facility, for a reasonable fee.  In the midcentury, however, everything changed. The women’s hotel, writes Daniel Lavery in his exceptionally charming new novel, found itself “made obsolete by the credit card, by hippies and the New Age movement, by lesbianism and feminism, by the increase in affordable apartment stock and the increased acceptance of premarital cohabitation.”  Lavery’s story takes place in the 1960s, in the dying days of the women’s hotel. New York’s Biedermeier hotel, where his focus lies, was always a second-rate facility, but now, its profits are so low that it has had to stop serving breakfast, a move the penny-pinching residents take as a deep affront. (“We’re all used to breakfast now,” one laments. “It’s like smoking. You can’t just ask people to give it up once they’ve made a habit of it.”) Lavery tracks the foibles of the Biedermeier’s band of misfits with a light touch. His characters were driven to its dubious comforts by family estrangement, addiction, poverty, and ambition above their means; dark subject matter, yet he writes their story with a tender affection. This novel is sweet, thoughtful, and very, very funny. All book critics have to spend a lot of time making our way through mediocre books where the prose starts off feeling solid enough but begins to fall apart in your hands as you read on. There is so much relief, under those circumstances, in turning to a Sally Rooney novel: taking the weight of her elegant, deeply felt sentences; feeling how much control she has over the words she’s using; how strongly she believes that they should be as beautiful as she can make them. At last, the chance to relax in the presence of someone who knows what she’s doing.  Beauty is where God is, which means it’s all connected to what right and wrong are, too.  In Intermezzo, Rooney shifts her usual focus on romantic couples to spotlight the re lationship between brothers Peter and Ivan. Peter is a lawyer in his 30s, charming, fastidious, and depressed. Ivan is an aging chess prodigy in his 20s, awkward and perhaps autistic, trying to evolve away from adolescent flirtations with incel forums and still wearing braces on his teeth. We meet them in the aftermath of their father’s funeral, semi-estranged, each ignoring the other to focus on their own fascinating love lives. They ignore each other, they try to make up, they fight, they hurt each other as badly as they possibly can.  What elegance. What bliss. What beauty. Which is, as Ivan thinks, maybe the most important thing, anyway: Beauty is where God is, which means it’s all connected to what right and wrong are, too.  When young Mieczysław Wojnicz arrives at the mountain resort of Görbersdorf, Poland, in 1913, he’s looking forward to a brief, healthful, and relaxing sojourn. Wojnicz is consumptive, and, like the hero of Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain before him, he has put his faith in the pure mountain air to cure him.  On Wojnicz’s first day at the sanatorium, however, he arrives at his boarding house to find the dead body of his landlord’s wife stretched out on the dining room table. She’s killed herself, the landlord reports without emotion to the shaken Wojnicz.  In the wake of his disturbing discovery, Wojnicz tries to focus on the concrete rituals of sanatorium life: the cold showers and long hikes, the simple food and hard drinking, the long debates with his fellow patients about history and philosophy. Yet there’s something violent and misogynistic lurking behind these everyday habits. All of the women he meets around town seem despondent. The philosophical debates always seem to hinge on the inferiority of women. On those long mountain hikes, he keeps coming across eerily anatomical glory holes built into the earth itself.  Wojnicz doesn’t quite know what to make of all these horrors. But Olga Tokarczuk, the Polish novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2018, is playing a long game. One hint is in the title: Empusa is a Greek shapeshifter who feeds on men. Perhaps the dead woman on the table will be avenged in the end."
40,VOX,Sally Rooney’s new book is an exquisite return to form,https://www.vox.com/culture/373108/sally-rooney-intermezzo-review-new-book-author,1536,Constance Grady,2024-09-23,Entertainment,NA,NA,"In the deeply-felt Intermezzo, the celebrity novelist plays chess with God. by  Constance Grady If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Intermezzo, the first new book by Sally Rooney in three years, comes freighted with expectations. What will our first great millennial novelist do next? Will her new offering leave readers as emotionally wrecked as her previous works?  Rooney, who is Irish, writes elegant, emotionally rich novels, mostly about young people in Dublin struggling to navigate their endlessly fraught love lives under late capitalism. Her first two novels, Conversations with Friends (2017) and Normal People (2018), were both runaway successes. They were adapted into hit TV shows and launched the careers of their young stars. Professionally beautiful people kept getting photographed carrying the books around, with covers in strategically prominent places, like they were the hot new handbag of the season. With her last offering, 2021’s Beautiful World, Where Are You?, her publishers took the accessorizing literally: Big-name influencers could score a Beautiful World bucket hat and a Beautiful World tote bag to wear with their Beautiful World book.  Rooney is that rarest of creatures, a unicorn of the 21st century, a celebrity author of literary fiction. Any new book by her faces a certain amount of unavoidable scrutiny: After all this time, does she still live up to the hype? I’m happy to report that Intermezzo is exquisite. While the experimental and polarizing Beautiful World stayed largely out of the minds of its characters, with occasionally chilly results, Intermezzo is all rich inner monologue, as deeply felt as Normal People.  What’s more, it offers something for which Rooney seems to have been looking for a long time: a new way forward through the central concerns of her work. Here, love is played out through familial relationships rather than just romances, with male characters rather than dry intellectual women — and Rooney appears, for the first time, to be ready to stop apologizing for the romanticism of her work. Rooney’s previous novels played with Austen/Brontë tropes. In Normal People, college students Connell and Marianne are clearly meant for each other, but they keep breaking up in part because of their class differences. In Conversations with Friends, young Frances has to navigate her love for older, married Nick. This is the stuff of the marriage novels of 19th-century England, updated with texting and Marxism. Intermezzo, in contrast, is a play on the great Russian novels. It’s interested in questions about God, how we care for each other, and what gives life meaning. At the center of Intermezzo are two brothers, Peter and Ivan, lapsed Catholics who are struggling with the recent death of their father. Peter is 32, a lawyer, fastidious about the cut of his suits and the fabric of his scarves and the way he smiles at strangers, so as “to convey to the world at large a genial disposition.” Ivan is 22 and painfully awkward, still wearing braces, and considers himself almost incapable of interacting with other people.  “Certain kind of panache in his absolute disregard for the material world,” Peter thinks of Ivan. “Peter is the kind of person who goes along the surface of life very smoothly,” Ivan thinks of Peter. As a pair, they form a kind of study in different ways self-hatred can manifest: through either indifference to the outside world or meticulous attention to it.  We meet Peter and Ivan in the immediate aftermath of their father’s funeral, but both of them have other problems to deal with. Peter is still in love with his ex-girlfriend Sylvie, but after a vaguely-described traumatic injury has left her unable to have sex, she’s broken things off with him. (The plot devices you can get away with when you’re Sally Rooney!) Now he’s entangled with a college student and camgirl named Naomi, and fears he might be falling in love with her, too.  All this Rooney narrates in textured, impressionistic sentence fragments, thoughts flitting across Peter’s mind like birds you see flapping across a window pane, there and then gone. “The old life of pleasure gone and never returning,” Peter thinks as he waits to meet lost Sylvie: “accept, or else delude yourself, all the same in the end. The will to live so much stronger than anyone imagines.” He thinks about suicide, and whether God would ever forgive him for it.  Meanwhile, Ivan, a once-precocious teen chess prodigy who has seen his ranking drop in recent years, lives his life in complete sentences, clauses piled upon clauses, his inner monologue so sweetly innocent as to become transparent. “He feels himself to have been formed, somehow, with something other than life in mind,” Ivan thinks of himself. “He has his good qualities, kind of, but none of them have much to do with living in the world that he actually lives in, the only world that can be said in a fairly real way to exist.”  The plot devices you can get away with when you’re Sally Rooney! Ivan finds himself steadily more depressed to be living a life organized around chess, as he feels he probably hit his peak at age 15. His life starts to turn around when he meets 36-year-old Margaret, an elegant divorcée living in a small town where Ivan plays an exhibition chess game. Margaret becomes the third point-of-view character of Intermezzo, thinking in sedate, polished sentences about her confusing attraction to Ivan and how, playing chess, “his hands look precise and elegant, like the hands of a surgeon or a pianist.”  Their developing relationship is redemptive for Ivan, who has always considered himself beneath the attention of women, but ruinous for Margaret’s reputation in her conservative town. And while Peter is himself dating a college student, he doesn’t think it plausible that a “normal woman” of Margaret’s age would want anything to do with Ivan. The fight the brothers have over Margaret spirals out of control to be about their entire lives: how they cared for their father, how they should care for the family dog, what they owe to one another. One of the big questions in this novel is the question of God. Ivan thinks that he can find God when playing really good chess: “It’s like the order is so deep, and it’s so beautiful, I feel there must be something underneath it all.” Margaret, meanwhile, says that she doesn’t think about God in terms of beauty. “I suppose my idea of God is more to do with morality. What’s right and wrong,” she says. This binary between beauty and morality is traditionally at the center of Rooney novels. Her books are obsessed with whether or not it’s all right to live a life focused on aesthetic pleasure — playing chess like Ivan or writing stories like Connell in Normal People— when so much is wrong with the world and there’s so much political work to be done. By extension, they are obsessed with novels as an art form that exists so that their readers can experience beauty. “It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another,” thinks Connell in Normal People when he finds himself in “a state of strange emotional agitation” over Jane Austen’s Emma. Meanwhile, celebrity novelist Alice declares in Beautiful World that the problem with Western contemporary literature is that it relies on “suppressing the lived realities of most human beings on earth,” disowning her own work as insufficiently engaged with real human suffering.  Her books are obsessed with whether or not it’s all right to live a life focused on aesthetic pleasure when so much is wrong with the world Is it all right, Rooney novels tend to wonder, fretfully, to devote your life to the beauty of novels when, after all, probably the only morally correct thing to do in our current society is to start a Marxist revolution and blow up pipelines? Strikingly, though, in Intermezzo, Rooney introduces this binary and then collapses it almost immediately. “To me, it seems like it might be all related,” Ivan says. “Like, I don’t know, to find beauty in life, maybe it’s related to right and wrong.” As the novel goes on, Rooney continues to develop this idea: that perhaps the things in our lives that are beautiful and bring us joy should be embraced, even if other people might think that they’re wrong, and that perhaps this will lead us to goodness as God understands it. In chess, an intermezzo is an “in-between” move that turns a game in an unexpected direction. One way of reading Rooney’s Intermezzo might be as a bridge piece between the books she wrote in her 20s and what’s coming in her 30s: the novels that wondered if they had the right to exist, and the books that are done apologizing for what they are: richly realized novels about love and friendship and the way that both can make us whole as human beings. In the meantime, Intermezzo works beautifully as a book all its own. It’s as tender and lovely as you could ask for, and beneath the elegant rise and fall of Rooney’s oceanic sentences, the waters go deep."
41,MSNBC,Why Michael Vick coaching Norfolk State University makes perfect sense,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/michael-vick-head-college-football-coach-hbcu-rcna184757,923,Keith Reed,2024-12-20,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Norfolk State University, a historically Black college in Virginia, announced this week that former NFL quarterback Michael Vick will be the Spartans’ next head football coach. That means that 15 years after he was released from federal prison for his involvement in a dogfighting ring and nine years after he played his last NFL game, Vick is writing the next chapter in what has become one of the greatest redemption arcs in American sports this century. Vick is writing the next chapter in what has become one of the greatest redemption arcs in American sports this century. Not everyone is on board, of course. The president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had something negative to say about Vick. He’ll never be forgiven by some people. Still, Norfolk State and Vick seem to need each other. And there may be no one more qualified to teach players how to move forward after making disastrous unforced errors. In his prime, Vick was a gift to football. As a quarterback, he possessed the speed of a track star, the evasiveness of an elite running back and a cannon for an arm. When the Falcons drafted him from Virginia Tech in 2001, Vick became the first Black quarterback to be taken with the top overall pick in an NFL draft. And he turned the Atlanta Falcons, a perennial NFL also-ran, into a team everybody wanted to watch. In 2006, he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season, a feat that wouldn’t be repeated until Lamar Jackson did it 13 years later. The 10-year, $138 million contract the Falcons gave him in 2004, was, at that point, the largest contract any NFL player had ever signed. At the same time, Vick was making a series of awful choices that made it apparent that he didn’t fully appreciate how good he had it. In 2007, when he was 27 and at or near the peak of his athletic ability, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in a dogfighting ring near his hometown of Newport News. That ring also included suspected drug dealers who were under federal investigation. The details of what went on at Bad Newz Kennels — including the brutal executions of dogs that didn’t make the cut to fight competitively — were the main source of anger at Vick, but there was also anger that someone whose athletic ability was unrivaled and who had earned so much money and fame threw it away. The black-and-red #7 Falcons jersey gave way to a federal inmate number at prisons in Virginia and Kansas where he served a total of 21 months. When Vick got out of prison, he played first for the Philadelphia Eagles, then the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Though his game was never the same as it had been with the Falcons, his off-field turnaround had already begun. He sought mentorship and received it from Tony Dungy, the first Black NFL head coach to win a Super Bowl and a notably religious man. Vick, who had been notoriously private, even with teammates, started to come out of his shell. He wrote and spoke publicly about his mistakes. He expressed contrition for his crimes and even gratitude for his growth behind bars. He spoke out against dogfighting even as animal rights protesters showed up at football stadiums to jeer him. For some people, that anger doesn’t appear to have dimmed. In a statement to Fox News this week, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk called Vick a “charming, charismatic psychopath,” but she noted that at least she doesn’t believe he’ll fight dogs anymore. He sought mentorship and received it from Tony Dungy, the NFL’s first Black head coach to win a Super Bowl and a notably religious man. The Spartans have had one winning season this decade. They went 6-5 in 2021. Their 5-26 record since then means they’ve lost five times for every win. Norfolk State looks a lot like the program Jackson State University was before Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders took the helm of four years ago. Now Norfolk State is the HBCU turning to a former NFL legend hoping his coaching can drag its program into relevance. Sanders succeeded in turning Jackson State into a winner. Saturday, two years after Sanders left for Colorado, the JSU Tigers won the Celebration Bowl, considered the de facto HBCU football championship game. (The Tigers lost that game the two times they got that far during Sanders’ three seasons with the team.) It’s way too early to think about Vick leading Norfolk State to a Celebration Bowl, to broader relevance in the NCAA’s Football Championship Subdivision or even to a winning season. But he has a lot going for him: His fame (and notoriety) will certainly draw media attention to the school, and with him standing on the sidelines, making a recruiting pitch gets theoretically easier. In practice, Norfolk State will have to raise the kind of name, image and likeness money no HBCU has successfully put together yet to be successful. It’s possible, though, that Norfolk State is less interested in trying to compete with college football’s Power Five heavyweights and more interested in what Vick can teach its players about building character through adversity, about avoiding unforced errors in life and about rebuilding themselves, even after hitting rock bottom. If that’s the school’s goal, and if Vick can show that he knows how to teach something more important than X’s and O’s, then this gig just might work out. "
42,MSNBC,"5 surprisingly simple tips to enjoy a merry, less-stressed holiday season",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/5-surprisingly-simple-tips-enjoy-merry-less-stressed-holiday-season-rcna184772,1018,Selena Rezvani,2024-12-19,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"You know when you’re so stressed that your eyelid starts pulsating? Well, for much of my adult life, that’s how the holidays felt. The endless to-do lists, the pressure to host a perfect holiday gathering each year (and somehow come up with a specialty cocktail that had floating cranberries in it), the balancing act of family, work, and social obligations — it was all too much. It wasn’t until I realized I was absolutely miserable during one of my favorite times of the year that I decided to take control and change things. And I want to share how I did it, so you don’t have to let stress take over your holiday season either. The holiday season often brings a pressure to say “yes” to every invitation, event, and responsibility that comes your way. But here’s a secret: you don’t have to be everywhere or do everything. Saying “no” isn’t a sign of rudeness or indifference to others; it’s a powerful act of self-care. Like my mom always told me, “Sometimes less is more.” And when you commit to less, you prioritize the activities that align with your values and leave room for rest. Whether it’s skipping a holiday party you’re dreading or delegating a task at work, remember that your time and energy are limited. Protect them like a momma bear! The holiday season is synonymous with family time, but that doesn’t mean you have to tolerate toxic conversations, intrusive questions, or endless requests for favors. Set clear boundaries before gatherings. If certain topics are off-limits or you need time for yourself, communicate that. It’s perfectly fine to say, “I need a moment” or “That’s not up for discussion right now.” I’ve also learned to set boundaries by keeping events on the shorter side — staying 70 percent as long as I usually might. I find I can enjoy all the trappings of the event without being the last to leave (saving up a little energy for me). Your peace of mind matters, and healthy boundaries are key to preserving it. In the whirlwind of holiday activities, it’s easy to forget the importance of stillness. But even 10 minutes of quiet time can do wonders for your mental clarity and emotional well-being. Take a break from the noise and pressure of the season. Whether it’s a morning guided meditation on YouTube (this is how I drink my coffee in the morning before everyone else in my family wakes up), a short walk outdoors, or a few minutes of deep breathing with your eyes closed in your car, find small moments of stillness to recharge. Trust me — these moments can help you feel more grounded when the holiday hustle starts to pick up. The pressure to buy gifts can make the holidays feel like a marathon. One of the most toxic games I played with myself over the years was the hectic, self-imposed competition of “I didn’t buy enough!” I would scramble to get something more for everyone on my list, constantly second-guessing whether I was doing enough. But here’s a radical thought: You do not have to buy so much. Instead of stressing over an endless shopping list, focus on minimal-in-number, meaningful gifts that reflect the people you care about. A single thoughtful gift or even a heartfelt gesture can be more powerful than piles of presents. The holidays aren’t about buying more; they’re about enjoying more. Let go of the idea that more equals better, and you’ll find that simple gifts and a little less spending can bring much more joy. Perfectionism is a common trap during the holidays. We might feel the need to host the perfect dinner, decorate every corner of our homes or make everyone tins of Grandma’s famous fudge. But let’s get real: perfection is an illusion. Instead of chasing an impossible ideal, focus on what truly matters — connection, love, and gratitude. Celebrate the little, casual moments that make the holidays special, and release the pressure of doing it all perfectly. Maybe instead of hosting your neighbors and dealing with the stress that comes with it, you meet them at a local brewpub. The point is that you’re connecting with them — and taking some burden off you. The memories you create will far outlast any perfect Instagram photo. As we head into the holiday season, it’s important to remember that taking care of yourself is just as vital as celebrating with others. While indulgence can be tempting, maintaining balance is key. That means staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and giving your body the movement it craves. It doesn’t have to be a formal workout session at the gym — simple walks after meals, stretching, or light yoga can help keep your energy up and your stress levels down. And, just as you prioritize physical care, remember that a few mess-ups are part of the holiday charm. You don’t need everything to go seamlessly to enjoy the season. Embrace the messy moments — the laughter after a mix-up, the spontaneity of last-minute plans, and the real-life moments that make the holidays memorable. When we let go of the idea that everything must be flawless, we open ourselves up to joy that’s far more genuine. The holidays are a special time, but they don’t have to come at the expense of your health or happiness. Prioritize yourself. By putting these self-care practices into place, you’ll be able to savor the season without the added stress. Set boundaries, know that less is better, and remember that it’s OK to skip perfection in favor of authenticity and joy.

43,MSNBC,How the Skimm founder’s health struggle prompted a movement to help women prioritize theirs,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/theskimm-founders-health-struggle-prompted-movement-help-women-priorit-rcna181093,899,Daniela Pierre-Bravo,2024-11-20,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Since launching theSkimm in 2012, founders Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg have set out to reinvent the way young women digest news with their daily newsletter. Now, 12 years later – with an audience reach of 16 million – they are on a mission to tackle preventative healthcare. “Women face a lot of barriers when it comes to interacting in the medical world. Whether that’s because it’s hard to get appointments and make time to carve out to get the appointments, dealing with insurance, medical gaslighting, there’s a zillion different reasons where we know gender inequity comes up in the medical field,” Zakin recently told Know Your Value. To help women be in the driver’s seat of their own health, theSkimm recently launched a tool that schedules and tracks important medical appointments and screenings. As part of the theSkimm’s #Don’tWait campaign, the free and personalized tool covers everything from when and how to schedule your next OB-GYN appointment to navigating mental health screenings. Data shows women in the U.S. are spending less time prioritizing their own health. In fact, nearly half of women skip preventative care and screening appointments, while 70 percent of millennials and 74 percent of Gen Z women say they struggle to prioritize their health. For Zakin this is personal. In 2022 she underwent back surgery, and experienced lingering pain from the procedure. ""It was really debilitating,"" she said. ""I went to another doctor to get another opinion. And I remember this doctor said to me, 'maybe it’s just stress'."" Though she knew it was stress that was worsening her back pain, Zakin was disappointed to find she was left with few answers on next steps or treatment options.  Navigating the medical system, she found, required her to be her own best advocate. “It wasn’t until I continued to advocate for myself, [when] I finally found a doctor who was like, it’s your obturator muscle and the interior part of your hip,” she said. “I just needed a little bit of pelvic floor therapy and then I was fine. And I think about that moment a lot. I knew my body, I knew myself. I knew that something wasn’t right.” It wasn’t just Zakin’s experience that illuminated the challenges women face accessing health care, it was also the countless testimonies from their own friends, family, and even their readership — which is majority millennial women — that raised the need to create more awareness around women’s preventative health. “At theSkimm we’re all about how to make it easier to live smarter,” Weisberg told Know Your Value. “Advocating for yourself, especially in the healthcare space, is so important, and sometimes truly the difference between life and death for some people. And really, step one, when it comes to self-advocacy, is taking the step to make the appointment. And that is where this campaign started.” Yet for many women, preventative health is the last thing they think of when the demands of caring for others often take priority. Nearly nine out of 10 women who have children under 18 say worrying about their kids’ health is a barrier to prioritizing their own. “This is really about taking ownership of your health, and you can’t put on the oxygen mask for everybody else until you put your own on first,” said Weisberg, herself a mother of two. Between juggling her professional responsibilities and parenting, she often finds it hard to carve out time for her own health. “When you look at it, [women] are taking care of people, they are doing this. They’re just not doing it for themselves,” Weisberg added. “We’re also a part of a generation that saw us stay home and skip a lot of preventative health measures during the pandemic. So, there is kind of an influx that we’ve seen coming out of that, and we want to make sure that that care is not just directed to those wonderful people we take care of, but it also needs to be directed to our own health and wellbeing.” For theSkimm — which has an audience reach of 16 million across all platforms — this isn’t their first foray outside of news. The platform has branched into several other franchises, like theSkimm Money and theSkimm Well, as a direct result of their audience’s feedback.  “We’ve grown from the daily Skimm to having multiple different franchises that really map out how we’ve grown up with our audience. And as we’ve grown up, we’ve stepped into more responsibilities and that has meant, obviously, making decisions for yourself and the type of life you want to have,” Weisberg shared. Whether it's addressing readers’ concerns about sandwich-generation caretaking, to fertility challenges — and everything in between — both founders have diligently expanded their platform to serve the growing needs of their audience and meet them where they are. “All of that goes into the things that you think about during your day. How can we anticipate what you’re going to need? And how can we make it easier to navigate life, both big and small, and because all of those things really combined to take a toll on everything that this woman is trying to keep up with during her day,” Weisberg explained. Zakin and Weisberg said the goal behind the #Don’tWait campaign is to create a tangible tool that helps women “feel empowered and informed about their health.” The tool is available for free at theSkimm.

44,MSNBC,Aaron Rodgers' new Netflix doc is an 'enigma' wrapped in a contradiction,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aaron-rodgers-new-netflix-doc-enigma-covid-rfk-rcna184912,972,Jason Page,2024-12-19,Entertainment,NA,NA,"On Tuesday, Netflix released a three-part documentary chronicling the past and present of Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The title of the documentary is “Aaron Rodgers: Enigma,” but after spending over three hours with him, Rodgers feels less like an enigma to me and more like a contradiction.  Rodgers repeatedly says that he doesn’t care what people think of him. But he also agreed to let a camera follow him around for months in what certainly feels like an effort to reset a narrative that has become increasingly negative.  “Enigma” zips us through different eras of the potential future Hall of Fame quarterback’s youth and professional career. We are presented with a complex character seemingly trying to find happiness under the intense microscope of stardom. But while Rodgers claims to squirm in the spotlight, he has also courted plenty of controversy. But while Rodgers claims to squirm in the spotlight, he has also courted plenty of controversy. From a football standpoint, Aaron Rodgers is a savant. A man of many physical talents, his acumen and ability to process information quickly and under extreme pressure is proof that his brain doesn’t work the same way as most athletes. Rodgers operates almost as an offensive coordinator or head coach in the huddle. This natural football intelligence is a gift that few in his sport possess. His four Most Valuable Player Awards offer a lot of evidence of this, of course, but the documentary drives it home. Still, despite those MVP awards and a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011, we quickly learn two things about Rodgers: The accolades didn’t bring internal peace or happiness, and he’s a perfectionist who feels like that one title wasn’t enough.  Unfortunately, while this aging star's will to win remains strong, his disastrous season with the Jets proves that mind does not always triumph over matter. Indeed, this series spends a lot of time on Rodgers’ “journey” off the field. In recent years, his athletic prowess has been overshadowed by various controversies and personal grudges, including Rodgers’ fractured relationship with his family and the fallout from his younger brother’s appearance on the 2016 season of “The Bachelorette.” Rodgers’ stance on Covid vaccines takes up a large chunk of the third episode. During the 2021 season, Rodgers infamously answered a question regarding his vaccination status by telling reporters he was “immunized.” No follow-up question was asked. But it would later come out that Rodgers was not actually vaccinated. Instead, he had asked for a waiver, claiming he was allergic to one of the ingredients in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The NFL denied that request, and a few months later Rodgers was forced to quarantine after testing positive for Covid. In the documentary, Rodgers expresses some regret about how he answered the vaccination question but doubles down on the idea of “bodily autonomy.” Rodgers also claims flu shots are only 15% effective. But this isn’t true. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented many different benefits of the vaccine, including the way it significantly lowers the risk of hospitalization and death. Here we witness in real time the dangers of Rodgers’ “just asking questions” philosophy.  We also learn a lot about Rodgers’ use of the plant-based ayahuasca psychedelic and how it has helped to shape his opinions on spirituality and alternative medicine. But although we follow Rodgers around the world, on retreats in Costa Rica and Peru, little is explained about the natural hallucinogen. Is this all part of the Rodgers mystique? Or just a gap in the storytelling? Another segment of the documentary highlights Rodgers’ admiration for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. On a hike together, RFK Jr. probes Rodgers about his interest in potentially entering politics. Rodgers later talks about being offered Kennedy’s vice presidential post (he subsequently turned it down). The picture that emerges ultimately is of a relatively harmless seeker of truths. And much time is spent showing Rodgers’ quest for a deeper understanding of himself and the world around him. But the reality is more complicated, and Rodgers isn’t simply a misunderstood hippie in an alpha athlete’s body.  Rodgers expresses some regret about how he answered the vaccination question but doubles down on the idea of “bodily autonomy.”  Often couching his misinformation in pseudoscience or self-help speak, Rodgers has been accused of questioning everything from Dr. Anthony Fauci's response to the AIDS epidemic to whether Vladimir Putin is really that bad to some odd conspiracies about immigrants in the millitary. But the documentary doesn't delve deeply into these facets of his ""enigmatic"" persona. Neither does it mention how Rodgers incorrectly implied Jimmy Kimmel might have been friendly with deceased predator Jeffrey Epstein. (Rodgers gave a half-hearted clarification on the “Pat McAfee Show” in January, while McAfee himself offered a more forceful personal apology.) What does the future hold for Aaron Rodgers? He’s 41 years old and nearing the end of what's looking like his worst season ever as a professional. Recent reporting from The Athletic suggests massive dysfunction within the Jets organization under the ownership of Woody Johnson. Will Rodgers try to run it back one more time in New York/New Jersey under a new head coach? Or will he seek greener pastures (pun not intended)? Watching Rodgers' process in the past suggests we may not get answers quite yet. We are all ultimately the sum total of our lived experiences. And Rodgers is no different in that regard. While trying to convey that he is in a better place now emotionally, “Enigma” ultimately leaves you wondering whether Rodgers will ever truly find peace. He constantly speaks about the need to let go of ego. But the documentary suggests that is easier said than done.

45,MSNBC,The biggest problem with 'Mary' on Netflix isn't its casting,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mary-netflix-noa-cohen-joel-osteen-rcna182824,843,Anthea Butler,2024-12-08,Entertainment,NA,NA,"“Mary,” the new movie on Netflix, is a pastiche of the narrative of the birth of Mary, her life and the birth of Jesus. Meant to be inspiring, the movie’s mixed messaging makes it come off like a bad thriller, with the heroine of the film moving between obedience, defiance and resignation. I couldn’t decide if I was watching a bad supernatural movie set in the desert or a bad, violent, cheaply made thriller set in ancient times. Perhaps the answer is both. I couldn’t decide if I was watching a bad supernatural movie set in the desert or a bad, violent, cheaply made thriller set in ancient times. “Mary” was the dream of Joel Osteen, the Houston megachurch pastor and prosperity gospel evangelist, and it’s about as saccharine as his sermons. Osteen, an executive producer of the film, worked with Aloe Entertainment’s Mary Aloe, who stated she wanted the “Mary” film to be a “survival thriller.” If you survive watching it, then you’ll learn that Mary, played by Noa Cohen, is a “gift from God,” as we are reminded so many times. Cohen’s portrayal of Mary in this overblown, New Age retelling of her story wavers between dutiful, courageous and winsome. This Mary is not the stoic who gets pregnant by God; she is both obedient daughter and homemaker, and the most wanted woman in Galilee. Everyone, it seems, knows she is special, from Anthony Hopkins, who gives us an overwrought portrayal of Herod, to the random butterflies that follow her everywhere. “Mary” is the most recent portrayal of New Testament stories that recasts them into action thrillers. Like “The Chosen,” a series that’s been on multiple streaming services, the main point of “Mary” is  Jesus, but in this case, we’re getting the backstory about how he is born and the supernatural events that follow his mother Mary and Joseph. And this is my major issue with the film. To account for Herod’s paranoia about a Messiah, Mary is cast as a mythical figure, holy from the very beginning. Appearances from the angel Gabriel and Lucifer add to the mystical tone of the movie, paired with the violence of the Zealots and the Romans. Viewers are asked to believe that everyone knew Mary was someone special. And this is where the movie falls short. It strains credulity to think that everyone knew Mary was “the one,” that she was Neo more than 2,000 years before “The Matrix” was released. As a veteran of watching the old-style Christian historical films — like “Ben Hur,” “Barabbas” and “King of Kings” — a focus on Mary would be a welcome diversion. In many of the older biblical stories in film and television, women are relegated to ancillary roles, and there ought to be films that bring them into the lead. In this case, Mary is the star of the show, and she is loaded with kindness, humility and grit, but that’s not enough to make the movie worth your time. You might want to say a Hail Mary and pray afterward for wasting almost two hours of your life. And that’s before we even get to the controversy involving Cohen’s casting. Director D.J. Caruso is being criticized for his choice to pick Israeli Jewish actors for the film to, in his words, ‘ensure authenticity.’  Director D.J. Caruso is being criticized for his choice to pick Israeli Jewish actors for the film to, in his words, “ensure authenticity.” Opponents of the film have argued that ignoring the Palestinian roots of Mary and Joseph is an affront to their faith, while others say casting an Israeli to play Mary during the Israel-Hamas war is offensive. Unrelated to the casting of the actors, some Catholics who have watched the movie have called it blasphemous and historically incorrect. A YouTube page called “Theology of the Body Institute” has called the movie “dangerous” and is encouraging Catholics to take its online course on Mary. And Fr. Edward Looney goes through an entire article pulling apart what he believes to be extra-biblical sources used to enhance the basic Gospel story. A big problem with the movie is that it’s cobbled together in a way to try to make it appeal to everyone. Is it supposed to be an ancient epic? A love story? A supernatural thriller? Whichever one of those types of movies “Mary” is trying to be, it fails. The first 30 minutes shift from scene to scene without much connection and assume the viewer knows the contours of the story being presented. The violence and gore are gratuitous and used as spectacle. An even bigger problem is that “Mary” is a type of cinematic propaganda, the reframing of a biblical story to meet the social and commercial needs of many American Christians who seek to recast Jesus, Mary and other biblical figures to suit their modern political philosophies. This portrayal of the mother of Jesus is a turbocharged, 21st-century vision of a Mary who is a cross between “mother of God,” Barbie and a tradwife. Skip the movie. "
46,MSNBC,What to know about the new murder charge for suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gilgo-beach-killings-suspect-rex-heuermann-charges-rcna184971,911,Katie Phang,2024-12-20,Culture,NA,NA,"In a case that for years looked like it would remain unsolved, a new superseding indictment charging the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, Rex Heuermann, with the murder of a seventh victim continues to send a powerful message about the importance of justice for victims once cast aside by society. Heuermann entered a plea of not guilty to the allegations that he murdered Valerie Mack, initially known as “Jane Doe No. 6,” a 24-year-old woman from Philadelphia who was working as an escort at the time of her disappearance.  Her partial remains were discovered in 2000 in the woods in Long Island by a group of hunters whose dog alerted them to a plastic bag that contained human remains. Law enforcement, including the FBI, compared Mack’s DNA in 2020 to the evidence in order to determine the identity of the victim. Law enforcement also found a human hair on Mack’s left wrist; forensic testing led to the DNA profile of Heuermann’s daughter, who is not considered a suspect and would have been 3 or 4 years old at the time of Mack’s death. Six out of the seven alleged victims, whose killings spanned from the early ‘90s to 2010s, had hair recovered from their bodies that are forensically linked to Heuermann. Six out of the seven alleged victims, whose killings spanned from the early ‘90s to 2010s, had hair recovered from their bodies that are forensically linked to Heuermann, members of his immediate family, or others he was living with. Heuermann has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer argues that the DNA testing used in these cases is “unreliable.” His lawyer also claims that the prosecution has yet to show that any of the victims’ DNA was found inside of Heuermann’s home. In a court filing, the prosecution disclosed that law enforcement seized from inside of Heuermann’s house a hard drive that contained a Microsoft Word document, written in all caps, that they allege was used as a “methodical blueprint” for his murders. It was created in 2000, which is the year that Valerie Mack was murdered. According to reports, there were dozens of written entries, including “reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to get sleep before hunt and to have a story set.” Police also seized more than 350 electronic devices from Heuermann’s home. The continuing identification of Heuermann’s alleged victims creates an even bigger hurdle for his defense. Jurors usually don’t get to hear about a defendant’s other crimes or bad acts because there is a risk that the defendant might be found guilty if the jury thinks they had the propensity to commit the offense or if the jury thinks that the defendant committed the crime simply because he’s a bad person. But, in this case, the state of New York has a rule of evidence, commonly referred to as the Molineux Rule (4.21), which allows for an evidentiary exception in the following instances: to prove “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or conduct that is inextricably interwoven with the charged acts; or to provide necessary background information or explanation; or to complete the narrative of the subject event or matter.”  For example, in order to prove motive, common scheme or plan, absence of mistake or accident, prosecutors will likely attempt to get the court to agree that evidence of Heuermann’s other crimes should be admitted against him when he goes to trial. The “blueprint” document found on Heuermann’s computer that detailed plans to select, kill and dispose of alleged victims will be powerful evidence against him. The document includes “pre-prep”, “prep,” “post event” and “things to remember” sections, in which Heuermann set forth how to select a location without surveillance cameras and how to have an alibi and to avoid detection. Some sections also discussed how to dispose of physical evidence, like a body, and how to remove tattoos that might be used to identify the victim. Heuermann attempted to permanently delete this “blueprint” document, but forensic investigators were able to restore it. You can guarantee that the jury will hear about this consciousness of his guilt. Within its discretion, the trial court may conduct an inquiry or a hearing, outside the presence of the jury, to determine the admissibility and in particular whether there is sufficient evidence for the prosecution to use evidence pursuant to this Molineux exception. Although there is no requirement per se that the defense be put on notice in advance, the prosecution will likely file a notice indicating its intent to do so. Some other human remains are yet to be identified in the investigation, and, as we have seen in this new superseding indictment charging Heuermann with Mack’s murder, it’s possible more charges are to come.  The pursuit of criminal cases brings closure in some form to the families and loved ones of victims who have been historically forgotten or shunned because of the circumstances of their lifestyles. Arguably, Heuermann’s victims were selected because they were deemed easy targets and not important enough for people to miss them or care enough to investigate their disappearances and subsequent murders. Victims who had fallen through the cracks, run away from their homes, or were sex workers and escorts. These new charges and law enforcement’s ongoing investigation into missing persons possibly linked to Heuermann help set the record straight: These victims are worthy of justice, just like anyone else."
47,MSNBC,Netflix’s ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ is a brilliant adaptation of a sacred novel,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-series-review-rcna182498,1023,Julio Ricardo Varela,2024-12-11,Entertainment,NA,NA,"I’ve read “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” the Nobel Prize-winning novel by Gabriel García Márquez, six times: three in Spanish and three in English. It’s the book that made me want to be a writer. It will always connect me to the Latin American Caribbean and, as someone who identifies with a cultural legacy beyond the borders of the United States, made me feel seen. 'Cien Años de Soledad' is sacred, and I wasn’t sure Netflix would understand that. So, when I heard about the “One Hundred Years of Solitude” series premiering on Netflix on Wednesday, Dec. 11, I was skeptical. ""Cien Años de Soledad"" is sacred. It’s sacred to so many people, and I wasn’t sure Netflix would understand that.  “I don’t want Netflix to tell me what Colonel Aureliano Buendía looks like. I’ve always imagined he looks like my grandfather. As every Colombian has,” literature professor Gustavo Arango told Vanity Fair. The thought of attempting to adapt its brilliance to the screen immediately gave me pause. With good reason — this is one of the most significant literary works ever written. Its layers, themes and worlds are not easily translated into visual works. Even Gabo himself, as García Márquez was lovingly known, believed that no adaptation could truly capture the novel’s essence. It would take 100 hours to tell the story properly, he said. But the decision wasn’t his to make. After Gabo’s passing in 2014 and that of his wife, Mercedes Barcha, in 2020, the fate of an adaptation fell to their sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo. Ultimately, they gave their blessing. Remarkably, the first eight episodes of the 16-episode series succeed. Netflix and production company Dynamo must have known that the stakes were high and that adapting this cherished novel into a series was a task they couldn’t afford to get wrong. Imagine the reaction if this adaptation hadn’t delivered. It would have been a disaster for Netflix, and for those of us who consider Gabo’s work sacred, it would have felt like a betrayal. The adaptation isn’t a page-for-page interpretation of the novel, and it was never meant to be. While some will always bring up this critique as proof that the novel should have just been left alone, the Netflix series offers something else entirely: countless moments of brilliance that prove creating art from other works of art is still possible. The Netflix series offers countless moments of brilliance that prove creating art from other works of art is still possible. “One Hundred Years of Solitude” tells the sweeping, multigenerational saga of the Buendía family in the fictional Colombian town of Macondo. It’s a story about love, ambition, resilience and the cyclical nature of history. From the founding of Macondo by José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán to the eventual unraveling of their family over generations, the novel, and now the Netflix series, explore themes of time, loneliness and memory, all woven together with moments that blur the lines between reality and myth. It is one of the most human works of art ever produced, in that it reveals our condition as imperfect beings trying to navigate life.  “Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.” (“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.”)  That, to me, is the greatest beginning of any book ever written in either the original Spanish or the translated English. The series grounds the visual story with that opening line and draws the viewer in. The choice to film in Colombia and in Spanish might sound obvious, but it was a nonnegotiable. A reluctant Gabo still insisted that these two conditions would need to be met. For a viewer to truly embrace this adaptation, you have to watch it in the original language. We are talking, here, about the greatest novel in the history of the Spanish-speaking world. If you’re a non-Spanish speaker, subtitles will be your friend. Watching a dubbed version would strip away something essential. Grounding the series in the land and language that birthed the story wasn’t just a creative choice — it was a necessity. It’s what allows the series to step into the shadow of the novel and still hold its own. There is no question that the Netflix series gives fans a new layer they never could have imagined. The characters in Gabo’s novel are iconic and deeply embedded in the culture. Seeing them come to life on screen might have felt strange, but this is where the production truly delivers. Marleyda Soto, as the older Úrsula Iguarán, embodies the character’s resilience and quiet strength. Claudio Cataño’s portrayal of Colonel Aureliano Buendía is equally compelling, capturing both the arrogance of power and the profound solitude of a man who has lost his purpose. Marco Antonio González gives José Arcadio Buendía a blend of ambition and vulnerability that resonates with anyone who has dared to dream and faced the consequences when those dreams unravel. These performances, along with that of the entire ensemble, give this adaptation its heart. The performances of the entire ensemble give this adaptation its heart. It’s inevitable that the adaptation of a literary work with so little dialogue would, at moments, veer away from the original. But any time the adaptation feels as if it might lose its way, the omniscient narrator’s voice pulls it back. Gabo is always with us in this series, reminding us that his opus is already familiar, already part of us. For my circle of friends — children of Latin America and the Caribbean —  this novel unites us. “Cien Años” is our oxygen. The fact that this adaptation didn’t ruin that connection speaks to the care that went into its creation. Some masterpieces can thrive in new forms without losing their soul. I never thought I’d say that. As I wrote in The Latino Newsletter, after I watched the first season of the Netflix series, I began reading “Cien Años” — for the seventh time. "
48,MSNBC,Coaching North Carolina can't be what Bill Belichick had planned for himself,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bill-belichick-north-carolina-tarheels-rcna183972,1122,Keith Reed,2024-12-12,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Sports heroes rarely go out on their own terms, and the same appears to be true for the coach who’s been arguably the most successful antihero in football. Yes, I’m talking about Bill Belichick, who led the New England Patriots through an epic two decades of NFL dominance. The 72-year-old Belichick, who wasn’t directly involved with a football team this season for the first time since 1975, has been hired to coach next year’s team at the University of North Carolina. Belichick will be trying to make the transition from coaching pros who could be his sons to college players who could be his grandsons. Belichick will be the oldest head coach at any major college football program in the country, and he will be trying to make the transition from coaching pros who could be his sons to college players who could be his grandsons. He’ll attempt this feat at an age when most Americans who can afford it are enjoying retirement — and as college football players have more power than they’ve ever had. Irascible septuagenarian seeks career redemption by agreeing to lead entitled young men. What could possibly go wrong? How about everything? I won’t argue that The Hoodie, the nickname that Belichick’s preferred game-day ’fits earned him, has no shot at success in the college ranks. But I will argue that Belichick’s accepting a college coaching job is proof that he’s accepted that NFL owners don’t want him. Belichick wants an NFL job. With 333 wins in the regular season and the playoffs, he’s won the second-most games of any NFL coach, sitting 14 games behind the 347 won by Don Shula. He could possibly catch or pass Shula with a couple of more seasons on an NFL sideline. What more proof do we need that Belichick's time in the NFL is over than his losing coaching opportunities to far worse, albeit younger, coaches? Belichick is rightly regarded by most as the GOAT among NFL head coaches. Even fans who still hold New England’s cheating controversies against him have to admit that nine Super Bowl appearances and six Super Bowl rings make him the best game planner and football disciplinarian we’ve seen. His former players swear by his approach, and the opposing NFL coaches he’s humbled almost never speak ill of him — at least not publicly. However, Belichick’s past success didn’t guarantee NFL opportunities when he and the Patriots parted last season. ESPN reported that even Pats owner Robert Kraft told Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank not to hire him for their head coach opening.  The Patriots deny this. What’s not up for debate is that for all his winning, Belichick also earned a relationship for being controlling — he was also the Patriots’ general manager — and for being a difficult boss and employee. That perception still hasn’t faded in the NFL. The New Orleans Saints, the Chicago Bears and the New York Jets have already fired their head coaches, and the New York Giants, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Dallas Cowboys have head coaches who could be on the way out. It says something that a coach with Belichick’s incomparable rep would take a job at a 6-6 college program instead of waiting to see if an NFL team looking for a coach rings his phone. Belichick saw the door closing, if not already locked, on an opportunity to resurrect his glorious NFL career. Belichick saw the door closing, if not already locked, on an opportunity to resurrect his glorious NFL career, and UNC was happy to fling its doors open. The question is: Will Belichick like what he finds once he walks through it? (Other than, you know, the reported $10 million a year he’ll reportedly get and the royal status given to college football coaches, especially those in the South.) College football bears little resemblance to the sport it purported itself to be for most of Belichick’s coaching career, and he’s likely to find himself out of step. After decades of totally exploiting the free labor of “amateur” student-athletes, the NCAA is years into the name-image-and-likeness era, which allows big-time athletes to sign seven-figure deals before they even step on campus. Belichick will have a reported $20 million in NIL cash at his disposal to help with recruiting, but therein lies the rub. He has to go out and recruit, which means he with the gruff and grouchy demeanor has to persuade teenagers to sign up for his fabled no-nonsense brand of coaching. The upside: If you want to go to the NFL, who better to teach you the game? Sure, Belichick dealt with the NFL’s free-agency era just fine, but those players are under contracts collectively bargained by a union regarded as among the weakest in American pro sports. NFL players don’t have a transfer portal they can hop into when they don’t like their coaches. The NFL has a salary cap and a trade deadline, which can make it hard for players to force their way out of uncomfortable situations. Those things don’t exist at the college level. Belichick could well find himself, like some other coaches have lamented, spending more time on recruiting and managing player relationships than on actual coaching. No one who knows anything about Belichick can imagine him enjoying that. Another wrinkle is that when he was coaching the Patriots, Belichick had only one boss: Kraft. College football head coaches, especially those at public universities, have many masters. University presidents and athletic directors are part of a mix that also includes rich and powerful alumni boosters who are the ones who put the money in the NIL kitty to begin with. Then there are the public officials who have their own political interests (and sometimes those of taxpayers) to look out for. NFL players don’t have a transfer portal they can hop into when they don’t like their coaches. Kraft may have been able to coax Roger Goodell and the other NFL owners to make Spygate go away for the sake of “the Shield,” but imagine Belichick as a public employee, called to appear before a hearing of some North Carolina legislative subcommittee to talk about some aspect of his leadership of the Tar Heels. Maybe the only thing that’s a bigger part of the Belichick mythos than the New England dynasty he helmed is the idea that he’s the die-hardest of football guys, that nothing that makes him feel more alive than X’s and O’s and the turf under his feet watching one of his masterful game plans unfold. At UNC, he’ll get another chance, maybe his last, to stand in that glory. It’s just hard to imagine that this is the game plan the Hoodie drew up for himself. "
49,MSNBC,Latest drone invasion sightings in New Jersey have Trump up in arms. Here's the truth.,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/latest-drones-invasion-sightings-new-jersey-trump-truth-rcna184201,717,Neil Richards,2024-12-15,Technology,NA,NA,"The hundreds of unexplained drones reported flying over New Jersey and other states across the East Coast in recent days have caused both confusion and anxiety. Who is flying these unmanned aircraft over homes, military bases, and President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course? What do they want? And what are they trying to do — or find out? After all, most privately owned drones are, among other things, flying high-definition video cameras. The uncertainty posed by these unexplained flying objects has sparked concern, temporary FAA flight restrictions and many, many conspiracy theories. Some of these reactions seem far-fetched, like speculation about Iranian spies. But the fear on the ground is real. At least two local politicians are now calling on the military to shoot unidentified drones down.  (We wouldn’t recommend that.) Even Trump has weighed in. Anxiety about these unexplained flying objects is certainly understandable, as are calls for the investigation and regulation of the drone flights. There may be laws that are being broken here, and if no laws are being broken, maybe we need better laws. At their core, though, a lot of the concern here boils down to the need to better protect our privacy. New Jerseyans — like all Americans — don’t want others snooping in their private affairs, whether via mysterious flying video cameras hovering over their patios, data brokers scooping up their health and location data, or old-fashioned Peeping Toms. We don’t like it when other people invade our privacy — and for good reason. As I’ve written previously, our privacy matters a great deal. Privacy matters because information is power, and information about people means power over those people, regardless of whether we are talking about drone cameras watching us in our homes, social networks sharing sensitive data about us with advertisers, or artificial intelligence algorithms using our data to generate scores about our eligibility for health insurance, jobs or access to loans. To be sure, we already have a number of laws protecting our privacy from snoopers, whether those snoopers track us online, follow us home or fly through the air. Old trespassing and invasion of privacy laws protect us from unwanted intrusions into our private affairs. States — including New Jersey — often have criminal protections against unwarranted privacy invasions. In 2012, Rutgers freshman Dharun Ravi used a webcam to spy on his gay roommate Tyler Clementi and posted about it on social media. Clementi later took his own life by jumping from a bridge, and Ravi ultimately pleaded guilty to attempted invasion of privacy. And there are already plenty of rules for drone flights, depending on how large the drone is, and where, when and how high they fly. Even basic recreational flyers have to pass a basic FAA safety test. Almost all drones must be registered. Thus, many of the current calls for the FAA to prohibit the drone flights have less to do with the safety of commercial aviation than they do with more nebulous privacy concerns, though untracked or unauthorized drone flights can certainly pose a risk for the safety of airline passengers and flight crews alike. Hopefully, we'll get to the bottom of this mystery soon. But at the very least, the New Jersey drone mystery should be a wake-up call. We need our elected officials to act thoughtfully to protect our privacy against new technological threats, aerial and otherwise. No matter who is operating these drones, they are at best an off-putting nuisance and at worst a violation of our right to privacy. And the problem is even more true for our digital lives. The United States is one of the few Western democracies without a separate, dedicated federal data protection agency, and the state privacy laws that do exist often receive a failing grade from civil society groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center. And this doesn’t even really take into account the new generation of artificial intelligence technologies that businesses, governments, schools and universities are deploying to ingest and make decisions based on our personal data. New technologies like drones can be fun — and they certainly have some useful applications for business and government. But hopefully this drone mystery will drive lawmakers to regulate these technologies more thoughtfully, in ways that allow us to enjoy their benefits while also not sending entire states into a full-blown panic.

50,MSNBC,Why Juan Soto's massive Mets contract has made so many people furious,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/juan-soto-contract-new-york-mets-mlb-anger-rcna183433,1092,Anthony Fisher,2024-12-09,Entertainment,NA,NA,"It was one year ago today, Dec. 9, that the Los Angeles Dodgers announced they had signed pitcher/designated hitter Shohei Ohtani to a $700 million, 10-year contract — a mind-boggling sum that some sports commentators considered “obscene.”  But now that the New York Mets have signed superstar outfielder Juan Soto to a $765 million contract paid out over 15 years — by far the most expensive contract in professional sports history — Ohtani’s contract, with most of its money deferred for years down the road, looks like a bargain. With additional escalators in the contract, it’s possible the Mets could pay Soto well over $800 million by the time he’s 41.  Who are the Mets supposed to be if they’re no longer the lovable, hapless scrappy underdog cousins of the hated crosstown Yankees? Mets fans are rightfully ecstatic at landing the Dominican native, who already has a World Series ring (from the 2019 Washington Nationals), four all-star appearances, four Silver Slugger awards, a batting title and three top-five MVP finishes. And he’s only 26 — far younger than when most players reach free agency.  Many fans and casual observers see the Soto signing as everything wrong with the game, or sports in general. Some are demanding Major League Baseball institute a salary cap to enable competitive balance. And some baseball sentimentalists are wondering just who are the Mets supposed to be if they’re no longer the lovable, hapless scrappy underdog cousins of the hated crosstown New York Yankees? (It’s not insignificant that the Yankees, Soto’s most recent team, offered him nearly as much money as the Mets.)  To these I say, calm down.  First off, baseball already has revenue sharing and a luxury tax for teams with high payrolls. Since 2001, 16 of its 30 franchises have won the World Series. And as I’ve previously written on these pages, the myth of the small market team that just can’t compete is a cruel falsehood sold to fans by billionaire owners, often looking for publicly financed handouts.  Second, Mets fans need not worry about losing their underdog identity, because they’ve rarely been true underdogs in the open field of 30 MLB teams — they’ve just been managed poorly for most of the six decades of their existence. Save for a few lean years in the mid-2010s — when the Mets’ previous owners claimed the financial losses suffered from their investments in Bernie Madoff’s notorious Ponzi scheme severely limited their ability to spend — the Mets have for decades fielded among the highest payrolls in the game.  Ask any Mets fan of a certain age about “The Worst Team Money Could Buy,”  the 1992 team that was loaded with high-priced free agents and a record-setting payroll. That squad played such bad, uninspired baseball that the owners had each player sign a letter of apology to the fans at the end of the season. The following season was arguably even worse. Bobby Bonilla threatened a reporter in the clubhouse. Bret Saberhagen sprayed reporters with a water gun filled with bleach. Vince Coleman maimed a two-year-old girl and injured several others after a game in Los Angeles when he threw an M-80 explosive out of a moving car in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. All that stuff makes pitcher Anthony Young’s 27-game losing streak seem not quite as ignominious.  Red Sox fans will be the first to tell you that winning is more fun than losing, and they don’t consider their high-priced champions any less legitimate. Steve Cohen, the Mets’ current owner and one of the richest men in the world, seems willing to do anything he can to make better memories for Mets fans. He’s the first owner to cross the $300 million payroll threshold, and has been bold enough to own his failed free agent signings like Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander — eating a large part of their sunken contracts and trading them for draft picks. And the $75 million signing bonus Cohen gave Soto could be the sweetener in the deal that put it over the top against the Yankees’ offer. This kind of spending was once known as “buying championships” — which everyone (especially Mets and Boston Red Sox fans) hated when the Yankees were perceived to be doing it by spending lavishly on free agent players.  But now that the Red Sox have won four World Series over the past two decades — all with huge payrolls stacked with free agents — Sox fans will be the first to tell you that winning is more fun than losing, and they don’t consider their high-priced champions any less legitimate. And although Boston sports teams have won 13 championships since 2001, the region’s sports fans still cling to their previous identities as put-upon underdogs. (This should give hope to conflicted Mets fans fearful of losing their “lovable underdog” image.) Besides, rooting for Gotham’s new Goliaths provides Mets fans with a level of Yankee schadenfreude that was previously unthinkable. Say what you want about the late George Steinbrenner, he’d never allow his team to be outbid by the Mets. But his son, Hal, seems content to put out a high-priced roster good enough to make the playoffs and leave it at that. Now Yankees fans will have to watch Soto play in Queens — which has to be worth at least some of that $765 million.  So whether you’re a Mets fan who fears being seen as rooting for the rich, big market bullies, or the casual fan appalled by baseball salaries approaching ever closer to a billion dollars, or a Yankees fan ego-bruised by Soto’s crosstown departure — there’s something for everyone to hate about Juan Soto’s contract.  But not me. I’m a Yankees fan, but I appreciated Soto’s stellar single season in pinstripes, and the clutch at-bats that helped carry the team to the 2024 World Series (though the less said about that, the better). Professional sports fandom will break your heart, but I can’t get upset about a kid from Santo Domingo getting his piece of the multibillion-dollar pie that is MLB. Would it be more just if the billionaire owners kept all the profits while the players (aka, the workers) took less than they were worth on the open market simply for the honor of playing the game?  That’s not how I see it.

Saoirse Ronan poses for photographers upon arrival at the photo call for an ‘In Conversation’ event at the BFI Southbank, on Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024, in London. Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan may be juggling multiple releases and busy schedules, but the bright young stars managed to reunite on Wednesday in London for a conversation at the British Film Institute.  The former co-stars met on Greta Gerwig’s 2017 high school film “Lady Bird” and were paired up again several years later in her adaptation of “Little Women.”  Though professionally their lives have taken them in different directions, they’ve remained friends and will “dip back in every few years” to catch up, Ronan said. “That is what is so beautiful about this point in our lives, we’re really lucky that the two of us are doing really well and our paths can continue to cross,” Ronan added, as her husband, Jack Lowden supported from the audience. Both had busy years appearing in multiple film releases that are now vying for awards recognition.  Chalamet took on the role of Bob Dylan in James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown,” which is out Christmas day, and Ronan played a young alcoholic who tries to escape the depths of her addiction by moving home to the Orkney Islands in Scotland in “The Outrun.” Chalamet also stepped back into the role of Paul Atreides in the epic sci-fi “Dune: Part Two,” and Ronan starred in Steve McQueen’s “Blitz.” The audience watched back-to-back scenes of the collaborations with Gerwig. Chalamet quipped that a “Lady Bird scene is a lot better than I remember it being!” The conversation then shifted to their relationship with fame.  Chalamet said it’s the “most boring thing to talk about in my life.” Ronan agreed: “I just pretended that all of that doesn’t exist.” "
52,AP,"Meet Amy Allen, the songwriter behind the music stuck in your head ",https://apnews.com/article/amy-allen-interview-grammys-sabrina-carpenter-23f69f74777eecba3194cadccd43bbfe,989,Elise Ryan,2024-12-19,Culture,NA,NA,"Amy Allen looks back at her start in songwriting, as she heads into 2025 with four Grammy nominations under her belt - including album of the year and song of the year, for working on Carpenter’s album “Short n’ Sweet” and single “Please Please Please.” Songwriter Amy Allen - nominated for four 2025 Grammys, including album and song of the year for Sabrina Carpenters’ “Short n’ Sweet” and “Please Please Please” - explains why she and the pop star connect so well. Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent-free. And it’s grabbed the attention of the Grammys. The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (“Without Me”), Selena Gomez (“Back to You”) and Tate McRae (“Greedy”). Her contributions to Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House” earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Rosé, Reneé Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake. 2024, however, was the year Allen’s work became inescapable — thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter’s bubbly “Short n’ Sweet,” including “Espresso,” an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and “Please Please Please,” the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone’s favorite lyric? “Heartbreak is one thing, my ego’s another / I beg you, don’t embarrass me,” followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)  This fall, Allen’s work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks — an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar. “Once the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,” Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them. When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. “Short n’ Sweet” is up for album of the year and “Please Please Please” for song of the year.  Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for “Better Place,” a collaboration with NSYNC for “Trolls: Band Together.”  “People really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,” said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on “Short n’ Sweet,” of Allen.  AP Photo/Jae C. Hong “She just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, ‘anything is possible today,’” added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter’s album. “The ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.”  Allen’s path to professional songwriting wasn’t necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn’t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option. “I had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she’s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,” Allen said. “I knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.” “Espresso” came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones “were kids having fun and laughing and playing,” Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track’s cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (“that’s that me espresso”). Jae C. Hong Allen believes “Short n’ Sweet” found success through its quirky, playful pop — because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective. “The general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,” Allen said. “The artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it’s almost impossible for the public to turn away.”  In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff’s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from “Amy Allen,” her self-titled debut album released in September — a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop. Touring those songs came with a realization. “I love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,” Allen said. “But it’s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.” “Whether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,” said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song “Issues.” “I’m always going to go after both,” Allen said. The 67th annual Grammy Awards will be held Feb. 2, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. The show will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+."
53,AP,Barry Jenkins on why he made 'Mufasa' and how it changed him as a filmmaker ,https://apnews.com/article/mufasa-barry-jenkins-lion-king-interview-9c70f2933f428d78e12a3ad7eca077f5,1260,Jake Coyle,2024-12-17,Culture,NA,NA,"Filmmaker Barry Jenkins poses for a portrait to promote the film “Mufasa” on Monday, Dec. 9, 2024, in Los Angeles. Over the four years he’s spent working on “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Barry Jenkins estimates that he’s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times. The question of why Jenkins, the filmmaker of “Moonlight” and “If Beale Street Could Talk” and “The Underground Railroad,” would want to jump into the big-budget, photorealistic animated Disney world of lions and tigers has bedeviled much of a film world that reveres him. Countless other directors had made leaps into CGI-heavy blockbuster-making before. But Jenkins’ decision was uniquely analyzed – perhaps because there’s no more heralded, or trusted, filmmaker today under the age of 50 than Jenkins. “It just thought it was something I could not deny,” Jenkins says. “I had to do it.” “Mufasa,” which opens in theaters Friday, brings together movie worlds that ordinarily stay very far apart. On the one hand, you have the Oscar-winning, 45-year-old director of some of the most luminous and lyrical films of the past decade. On the other, you have the intellectual property imperatives of today’s Hollywood. What happens when they collide? The result in “Mufasa,” about the lion cub’s orphaned upbringing set both before and after the events of Jon Favreau’s 2019 remake of “The Lion King,” is an uncommonly textured and thoughtfully rendered spectacle that, Jenkins maintained in a recent interview, has more in common with “Moonlight” than you’d think. Made with virtual filmmaking tools, “Mufasa” essentially plopped one of the most groundbreaking filmmakers working today into an all-digital playground, with a budget more than a hundred times that of “Moonlight.” Often in “Mufasa,” you can feel Jenkins’ sensibility warming and enhancing what can, in other less sensitively commanded films, feel soulless. With songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, “Mufasa” works as a big-movie entertainment and, even more surprisingly, as a Barry Jenkins film. “My head was spinning when this started,” Jenkins says. “It actually reminded me of when I first got into filmmaking. This felt oddly enough very similar to that first experience. You can sort of run away from that newness and be intimidated by it, or you can embrace it, learn the things you don’t know and then start to bend it.”  It’s also an experience that has quite evidently changed Jenkins, exponentially expanding his filmmaking tool kit while opening his eyes to new ways of making movies. “It was almost like learning a new language,” Jenkins says of the process. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Jenkins: At least 400 times. But it came down to the spirit and the warmth of Jeff Nathanson’s script and also the spirit and the warmth I always found in the story. I came to “The Lion King” by babysitting my nephews way, way back in the 1990s. My sister was a single mom and I’d be at home watching with the kids. You’d put on different VHSs and “The Lion King” was always the one that stuck. I just thought: Wouldn’t it be interesting to, coming out of something like “The Underground Railroad” to step into this thing that’s so full of light? JENKINS: Maybe warmer, lighter but still just as deep, just as spiritual. This idea of family legacy, of finding your place in the world, those are things that are very present in “Moonlight” and “The Underground Railroad.” If I was telling you, “I’m going to make this film about this kid who has this almost biblical experience involving water and a parent figure that he then gets displaced from, and has to find his place in the world, I could be talking about “Moonlight” or I could be talking about “Mufasa.” Kelvin Harrison Jr., Tiffany Boone, Aaron Pierre, Anika Noni Rose, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogan and Barry Jenkins at a London “Mufasa” photo call. JENKINS: It wasn’t about the notions of who people thought I was. But I was looking to expand just the kind of filmmaking I was doing at that point. This came right in the thick of pretty much a seven-year cycle, from beginning “Moonlight” to being in post on “The Underground Railroad,” the way this movie is made, with this virtual production, it’s just a very new way of making films. There’s maybe been five or six movies made with this technology. JENKINS: I did. We evolved this process to the point where we could create so much of all the world and the movement in virtual space, and we could then take our virtual cameras into virtual production. We evolved the animation to the point where we could create the light, we could create the set, we could create the environment. (Cinematographer) James (Laxton) would be there and I would be there, and we’re blasting the voices of the actors into the room and the animators are moving through and I’m directing the blocking, and the camera is responding to the blocking in real time.  JENKINS: Absolutely. Look, I’m a filmmaker who was on set with “Moonlight,” I’ve got 25 days and the sun is going down. Yeah, you’re trying to find a place for the camera, you have ideas, but those ideas aren’t practically achievable. In this sense, the camera could be anywhere. It could be everywhere. It’s sort of the same questions but the possibility of answering is so immediate and direct. JENKINS: I want to unpack what you just said. We’ve been talking, and I’ve been talking about using these tools to create a very physical, in-person experience. I don’t consider this a project that’s all digital and all computer animated. If I made this movie again right now, it wouldn’t take me four years. It’d probably take me two and a quarter. If I was going to do another one of these films, I would have such a stronger foundation. It wouldn’t feel like something that’s alien or something that’s other or that’s all digital. It would just feel like filmmaking. JENKINS: One thousand percent. I love through this process I’ve learned so many other ways of making a film that I just could not learn making something like “The Underground Railroad.” What I love now is the overlap between the two of them. When I began this process, I talked to Matt Reeves because I had heard he had used some of these tools to pre-vis “The Batman.” He said, “Do you know that shot where the Penguin is in his car and Batman is walking upside down? I discovered that in the volume.” I said, “Of course you did.” I was like, Oh my God, we could have pre-vised “Moonlight” with this technology. JENKINS: One thousand percent. The light can be anywhere in this film and the camera can be anywhere. That doesn’t mean it should be everywhere. The next time I go out to make a film whether it’s something like “The Underground Railroad” or “Beale Street,” James and I are probably going to incorporate these tools as well. Because figuring out the light is half the battle, as they say in “G.I. Joe.” JENKINS: This is all new. It’s all being developed right now. We went down to “Avatar” and spoke to the engineers there. They heard what we were trying to do and sent some people to embed with us and they helped us evolve our process, so we could have these animators with two legs move as if they have four legs. What I’m saying is: This is the wild, wild West."

In a statement released Thursday through Aurora Global Consulting, Sosa said he was sorry for mistakes without specifying them. “There were times I did whatever I could to recover from injuries in an effort to keep my strength up to perform over 162 games,” he said. “I never broke any laws. But in hindsight, I made mistakes and I apologize.” Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts said the team is “ready to move forward together” with Sosa and plans to invite him to the annual fan convention Jan. 17-19 in Chicago. “We appreciate Sammy releasing his statement and for reaching out,” Ricketts said. “No one played harder or wanted to win more. Nobody’s perfect but we never doubted his passion for the game and the Cubs. It is an understatement to say that Sammy is a fan favorite.” Sosa, the franchise’s record holder with 545 home runs, was traded to Baltimore after he showed up late for the 2004 finale at Wrigley Field and left early. Sosa, Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, all tainted by allegations of performance-enhancing drugs use, fell well short of Hall of Fame election in 2022 on their 10th and final appearance on the Baseball Writers’ Association of America ballot. Sosa received a high of 18.5% support in his final appearance, less than a quarter of the 75% needed. His next chance for consideration would be if he is placed on the ballot for the contemporary player committee, which meets next December. Now 56, Sosa was a seven-time All-Star and the 1998 NL MVP for the Cubs. He hit .273 with 609 home runs — currently ninth on the career list — with 1,667 RBIs and 234 stolen bases in 18 major league seasons from 1989 to 2007 with Texas (1989, 2007), the Chicago White Sox (1989-91), the Cubs (1992-04) and Baltimore (2005). During congressional testimony in 2005, Sosa denied using performance-enhancing drugs. “We accomplished great things as a team, and I worked extremely hard in the batting cage to become a great hitter,” Sosa said in his statement. “Cubs’ fans are the best in the world, and I hope that fans, the Cubs and I can all come together again and move forward. We can’t change the past, but the future is bright. In my heart, I have always been a Cub, and I can’t wait to see Cubs fans again.” "
55,AP,Google unveils Gemini 2.0 AI as antitrust case looms ,https://apnews.com/article/google-artificial-intelligence-gemini-agents-openai-e45758d1198a13e322db0fc208dea621,754,Michael Liedtke,2024-12-11,Technology,NA,NA,"Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks about Gemini at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology’s cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire. The next generation of Google’s AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches. In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will “understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.” It’s a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software. A lot of Google’s latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube. Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone’s “Apple Intelligence” features that spruced up the device’s Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday. Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case. Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered “answer engines” such as Perplexity. After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year. The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed “Project Astra,” with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group’s size. As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called “Project Mariner,” which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don’t won’t have to bother.  If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department’s proposal as “overly broad” and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.  Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion. “I can’t wait to see what this next era brings,” Pichai wrote in his blog post, signaling the company doesn’t believe it will be deterred by regulators."
56,AP,Drone sightings in New Jersey: Homeland security officials meet with lawmakers ,https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-a978470fa3bb07ed3e98c5b7c18f0abb,944,Bruce Shipkowski,2024-12-11,Technology,NA,NA,"A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why. Witnesses have spotted a cluster of what appear to be drones — larger than those typically used by hobbyists — as well as a possible fixed-wing aircraft flying in several areas along the Raritan River in New Jersey since Nov. 18. The FBI is investigating. The Pentagon is weighing in on a number of drone sightings in the skies over New Jersey. People started spotting dozens of mysterious nighttime flights last month. Multiple drones are seen over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024 Drones, planes or UFOs? Americans abuzz over mysterious New Jersey sightings. The large mysterious drones reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker briefed Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security. In a post on the social media platform X, Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia described the drones as up to 6 feet in diameter and sometimes traveling with their lights switched off. The Morris County Republican was among several state and local lawmakers who met with state police and Homeland Security officials to discuss the spate of sightings that range from the New York City area through New Jersey and westward into parts of Pennsylvania, including over Philadelphia. The devices do not appear to be being flown by hobbyists, Fantasia wrote. Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility; and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.  Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. The number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It’s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. Gov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have. A senior FBI official told the House Homeland Security Committee Wednesday the recent drone sightings above New Jersey are “concerning,” and said the agency is “actively investigating” the situation and trying to determine who is responsible. Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, U.S. Reps. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones.  Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer briefed him on an incident over the weekend in which a dozen drones followed a motorized Coast Guard lifeboat “in close pursuit” near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County. Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press Wednesday “that multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park.” The aircraft weren’t perceived as an immediate threat and didn’t disrupt operations, Pinneo said. The Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies in investigating.  In a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Smith called for military help dealing with the drones, noting that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has the capability “to identify and take down unauthorized unmanned aerial systems.” However, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters Wednesday that “our initial assessment here is that these are not drones or activities coming from a foreign entity or adversary.” A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why. Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state.  “This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,” Murphy said earlier this week. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said he did not attend Wednesday’s meeting. Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he also attended Wednesday’s meeting at a state police facility in West Trenton. The session lasted for about 90 minutes. Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones. So who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? “My understanding is they have no clue,” Peterson said.  A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states. James Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month. “It raises concern mainly because there’s so much that’s unknown,” Edwards said Wednesday. “There are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.”"
57,AP,How to avoid financial stress during the holiday season,https://apnews.com/article/holiday-shopping-financial-stress-money-wellness-32c10b07d9d75ba862d911c01845ba34,1019,Adriana Morga,2024-12-18,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Shoppers walk along Fifth Avenue on Nov. 29, 2024, in New York. The holidays are meant to be a time of celebration with family and friends. But they can also bring pressure to spend money on gifts, gatherings and plane tickets home, exacerbated by brand emails, social media influencers and family expectations. With credit card debt rising and prices for many items still high due to inflation, overspending during the holiday season can add to the financial stress many Americans are already experiencing, said Dr. Marketa Wills, CEO and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association. “The idea that one is on the hook for buying gifts for all their friends and families adds an enormous amount of stress on someone trying to have a perfect holiday,” Wills said.  But there are ways to get through the holidays without spending more than you can afford. From setting expectations with your family to making a budget to gifting experiences rather than things, here are expert recommendations to avoid financial stress this holiday season: To avoid overspending on gifts for family and friends, set a specific goal, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app. Ask yourself what your spending limit is before you start shopping. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on spending during the holidays. “People get into ‘justification mode’ where you have a general sense of what you want to spend but then you see this really nice thing and all of the sudden you’ve done that a few times and you spend twice as much as you thought you might,” Watson said. Watson also recommends that you include in your budget calculations how much you’ll pay for taxes and shipping.  In many families, the holidays mean going all out with gift-giving. But this can quickly become stressful if your finances make it hard to keep up. Managing expectations is key.  “You can avoid feeling inadequate, or like you’re not doing a good job, by having an honest conversation about where your finances are,” Watson said. Being open about your money can be difficult, but sharing if you are struggling with debt or other financial issues can help family and friends understand that they should prioritize low-cost gifts or activities.  Planning your holiday shopping ahead of time can make it easier to stick to your budget,. “When people feel rushed, oftentimes they’re going to buy more expensive things,” said Watson, who also pointed out that shipping costs increase closer to Christmas.  As you budget for the holidays, make a list of the items you want to purchase and slowly start buying them. This way, you divide your costs among several paychecks and avoid relying on credit for last-minute expenses.  Wills recommends that people opt for homemade gifts if they want to show appreciation for their loved ones without overspending. Homemade gifts don’t always have to be crafts, they can also be actions. “I will do babysitting for you, I will cook a meal for you,” Wills said. “Those kinds of things take a financial pressure off and make for a more joyous holiday season.”  In recent years, shopping expert Trae Bodge has noticed that younger people prefer to gift each other experiences rather than items. She recommends finding affordable, fun activities to do with your loved ones. Examples include going ice skating, hiking or hosting a potluck. You could also gift a photoshoot or framed pictures or digital albums to commemorate happy experiences. Expectations or traditions you grew up with, such as buying expensive gifts for every member of your extended family, can cause stress during the holidays. This is what Bodge refers as “keeping up with the Joneses,” which refers to trying to keep up with the expectations of other people rather than what is realistic for you to spend. “Sometimes you may have a family member that is very financially well-off and they love to treat you to big, extravagant things. If you’re not in that same financial position, you should not feel compelled to return the favor,” Bodge said. When creating your own new traditions, Watson recommends sharing the financial goals you have, such as saving for a house or paying off debt. This will help your loved ones understand why you’re looking to limit expenses during the holidays. Wills also recommends cutting costs by being selective with your expenses. For example, when it comes to hosting, even having a small group of people can be very expensive if you’re expected to pay for everything. If you’re in this situation, you could propose that everyone brings a dish.  “Think about having a potluck meal for the holiday. Have everybody bring something to the event to help share the cost,” she said.  If you are having financial difficulties, it can help to talk about it with your family and friends. “Sharing about stress can in and of itself be therapeutic for the individual who may be having concerns for that during the during the holiday season,” Wills said. Making room to listen to your loved ones’ feelings is equally important, she said. And if the holidays are a tough time for you, Wills recommended that you prioritize your mental health and good habits such as resting well and exercising.  It’s the season where social events are happening every weekend but if they are causing you too much financial stress or hurting your mental health, it’s okay to be selective. Additionally, if you start feeling uncomfortable about certain conversations with your family, Wills recommends you take some time for yourself by taking a walk or removing yourself from the conversation.  If you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help. In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free. Other mental health resources include: Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) Crisis Text Line: Text the word ‘Home’ to 741-741 The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386 The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860 The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass, File) U.S. women’s team forward Trinity Rodman has opened up about her strained relationship with father, Dennis Rodman, saying he is largely absent from her life.  “He’s not a dad. Maybe by blood, but nothing else,” Trinity Rodman told host Alex Cooper on the Call Her Daddy podcast. Rodman said that growing up, her mother tried to shield her two children from the chaotic lifestyle of the former NBA star. Rodman’s mother, Michelle Moyer, divorced Dennis Rodman in 2012.  Trinity Rodman, who won a gold medal with the United States this summer at the Paris Olympics, has a brother, DJ Rodman, who currently plays in the NBA’s G League.  Dennis Rodman responded to his daughter on Instagram, saying he is sorry he “wasn’t the dad you wanted me to be” and said he tried to be a father and will keep trying.  “I will try even when it’s difficult and if it takes a long time. I’m always here And tell you all the time rather it’s your voice or voicemail how proud I am. I always had one wish and it was I wish my kids would call me and come see me. Hopefully one day I can get that,” he wrote in the post.  Trinity Rodman, who also plays for the Washington Spirit in the National Women’s Soccer League, recalled how her father showed up unannounced at a Spirit playoff game in 2021.  She hadn’t spoken to her father in months and was emotional during the game, then was photographed crying in his arms afterward.  “The whistle blew and I was so mad, like, ‘You took this happy moment from me. You (expletive) with my head again,’” she said on the podcast.  “I think after that was when I lost hope of ever getting him back. It was just like, he’s popping in whenever he’s going to be on a camera,” Trinity Rodman said. “Even at that game, I don’t think it was for me, I think he wanted to have a good conscience. and then be like, ‘Headline, Dennis Rodman showed up to his daughter’s game.’” Trinity Rodman went on to win a title with the Spirit that year and was named NWSL Rookie of the Year. She said that after that game she didn’t speak to her father again until after the 2023 Women’s World Cup.  Dennis Rodman won five NBA championships over a 14-year career. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.  AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Luigi Mangione agreed on Thursday to be extradited at a court appearance in Pennsylvania where he was arrested last week after five days on the run. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, arrived at Federal Court in New York to face an upgraded murder charge Thursday. Luigi Mangione, the man charged in the killing of United Healthcare’s CEO, arrived at a Pennsylvania courthouse early Thursday for a hearing. He may soon be returned to New York The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will return to New York to face murder charges. Luigi Mangione agreed on Thursday to be extradited at a court appearance in Pennsylvania where he was arrested last week after five days on the run. Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is escorted by police, Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024, in New York. Attorney Thomas M. Dickey, who represents Luigi Mangione, speaks to the media outside the Blair County Courthouse on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024, in Hollidaysburg, Pa. Supporters of Luigi Nicholas Mangione, who is being charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, gather at the front of Blair County Courthouse for the suspect’s preliminary and extradition hearing in Hollidaysburg, Pa., Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024. Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is escorted by police, Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024, in New York. The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was whisked back to New York by plane and helicopter Thursday to face new federal charges of stalking and murder, which could bring the death penalty if he’s convicted. Luigi Mangione was held without bail following a Manhattan federal court appearance, capping a whirlwind day that began in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested last week in the Dec. 4 attack on Brian Thompson. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate had been expected to be arraigned Thursday on a state murder indictment in a killing that at once rattled the business community and galvanized some health insurance critics, but the federal charges preempted that appearance. The cases will now proceed on parallel tracks, prosecutors said, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Mangione, shackled at the ankles and wearing dress clothes, said little during the 15-minute proceeding as he sat between his lawyers in a packed federal courtroom. He nodded as a magistrate judge informed him of his rights and the charges against him, occasionally leaning forward to a microphone to tell her he understood. After the hearing, a federal marshal handed Mangione’s lawyers a bag containing his belongings, including the orange prison jumpsuit he had worn to court in Pennsylvania. Mangione had been held in Pennsylvania since his Dec. 9 arrest while eating breakfast at a McDonald’s in Altoona, about 233 miles (37 kilometers) west of Manhattan. At a hearing there Thursday morning, Mangione agreed to be returned to New York and was immediately turned over to at least a dozen New York Police Department officers who took him to an airport and a plane bound for Long Island.  He then was flown to a Manhattan heliport, where he was walked slowly up a pier by a throng of officers with assault rifles — a contingent that included New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The federal complaint filed Thursday charges Mangione with two counts of stalking and one count each of murder through use of a firearm and a firearms offense. Murder by firearm carries the possibility of the death penalty, though federal prosecutors will determine whether to pursue that path in coming months. In a state court indictment announced earlier this week, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office charged Mangione with murder as an act of terrorism, which carries a possible sentence of life in prison without parole. New York does not have the death penalty.  Mangione’s lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, said it’s a “highly unusual situation” for a defendant to face simultaneous state and federal cases. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, was taken back to New York by plane and helicopter Thursday to face federal charges of murder and stalking, escalating the case after his earlier state indictment. “Frankly I’ve never seen anything like what is happening here,” said Friedman Agnifilo, a former top deputy in the Manhattan district attorney’s office. She reserved the right to seek bail at a later point and declined to comment as she left the courthouse.  Mangione, of Towson, Maryland, is accused of ambushing the 50-year-old Thompson as the executive arrived to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition investigators found at the scene, echoing a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims. The gunman then pedaled a bicycle through Central Park, took a taxicab to a bus station and then rode the subway to a train station before fleeing to Pennsylvania, authorities said. There, a McDonald’s customer noticed that Mangione looked like the person in surveillance photos police were circulating of the gunman, prosecutors said.  When he was arrested, they say, Mangione had the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport, fake IDs and about $10,000. According to the federal complaint, Mangione also had a spiral notebook that included several handwritten pages expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives. UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the U.S., though the insurer said Mangione was never a client. An August entry said that “the target is insurance” because “it checks every box,” according to the filing. An entry in October “describes an intent to ‘wack’ the CEO of one of the insurance companies at its investor conference,” the document said. Mangione initially fought attempts to return him to New York. In addition to waiving extradition Thursday, he waived a preliminary hearing on forgery and firearms charges in Pennsylvania. The killing unleashed an outpouring of stories about resentment toward U.S. health insurance companies while also shaking corporate America after some social media users called the shooting payback. Mangione, a computer science graduate from a prominent Maryland family, repeatedly posted on social media about how spinal surgery last year had eased his chronic back pain, encouraging people with similar conditions to speak up for themselves if told they just had to live with it.  In a Reddit post in late April, he advised someone with a back problem to seek additional opinions from surgeons and, if necessary, say the pain made it impossible to work. “We live in a capitalist society,” Mangione wrote. “I’ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it’s impacting your quality of life.” He apparently cut himself off from family and close friends in recent months. His family reported him missing in San Francisco in November.  Thompson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, was trained as an accountant. A married father of two high-schoolers, he had worked at UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. Scolforo reported from Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.

60,AP,What to know about California's bird flu emergency,https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-h5n1-spread-people-e5edab844b409b8ba21feaecb10156d0,1007,Jonel Aleccia,2024-12-21,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Health officials on Wednesday confirmed the first known severe illness in the U.S. caused by bird flu, and California’s governor declared a state of emergency as the virus rampages through dairy cattle in the state. H5N1 bird flu is spreading through cows, poultry, and wild birds, causing sporadic illnesses in people across the United States. One virologist weighs in on who’s most at risk and what precautions should be taken to avoid exposure. California officials have declared a state of emergency over the spread of bird flu, which is tearing through dairy cows in that state and causing sporadic illnesses in people in the U.S.  That raises new questions about the virus, which has spread for years in wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species. The virus, also known as Type A H5N1, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.  More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation’s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week.  Here’s what you need to know. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he declared the state of emergency to better position state staff and supplies to respond to the outbreak.  California has been looking for bird flu in large milk tanks during processing. And they have found the virus in at least 650 herds, representing about three-quarters of all affected U.S. dairy herds.  The virus was recently detected in Southern California dairy farms after being found in the state’s Central Valley since August. “This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed again this week that the virus poses low risk to the general public.  Importantly, there are no reports of person-to-person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among humans. In general, flu experts agreed with that assessment, saying it’s too soon to tell what trajectory the outbreak could take. “The entirely unsatisfactory answer is going to be: I don’t think we know yet,” said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. But virus experts are wary because flu viruses are constantly mutating and small genetic changes could change the outlook. This week, health officials confirmed the first known case of severe illness in the U.S. All the previous U.S. cases there have been about 60 were generally mild. The patient in Louisiana, who is older than 65 and had underlying medical problems, is in critical condition. Few details have been released, but officials said the person developed severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock of sick birds. That makes it the first confirmed U.S. infection tied to backyard birds, the CDC said. Tests showed that the strain that caused the person’s illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.  Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases — an adult in Missouri and a child in California — health officials have not determined how they caught it. It’s possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.  Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.  “I assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,” Rasmussen said. People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said. “If birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should be very careful about how they handle those animals,” said Michael Osterholm, a public health expert at the University of Minnesota. The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu — and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.  In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products. In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats. Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu. The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.

61,Forbes,Forbes Highest-Paid Female Athletes 2024 List,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2024/12/18/the-worlds-highest-paid-female-athletes-2024/,2831,Brett Knight,2024-12-18,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Women’s sports are riding a wave of momentum, and the rising tide is—finally—starting to lift players’ pay. Indiana Fever rookie phenom Caitlin Clark, who helped push the WNBA to record highs for attendance and viewership, earned an estimated $8.1 million this year, matching the women’s basketball record set last year by the now-retired Candace Parker. Thai golfer Jeeno Thitikul took home a $4 million check at November’s CME Group Tour Championship—the largest prize in women’s golf history—while her LPGA Tour rival Nelly Korda finished with an estimated $12.5 million in total income, the best mark by a golfer in the 17 years Forbes has ranked female athletes’ earnings. Meanwhile, 20-year-old tennis star Coco Gauff’s estimated $34.4 million gives her one of the best years ever recorded by a female athlete, behind only Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams, who peaked at $57.3 million and $45.9 million in total earnings, respectively, on Forbes’ list for 2021. Together, the 20 highest-paid female athletes—a list that includes Korda at No. 8, Thitikul at No. 12 and Clark at No. 13, alongside the top-ranked Gauff—collected more than $258 million in 2024. That figure just edges 2022’s top 20, when Osaka and Williams accounted for more than $92 million between them, and represents a 15% increase over 2023’s $226 million. The women’s combined total, however, remains less than 12% of the equivalent number for the top 20 male athletes, who hauled in an estimated $2.23 billion on Forbes’ 2024 list of the world’s highest-paid athletes overall, tracking the 12 months ending in May. (No women featured in the top 50 of that ranking.) Traditionally, female athletes have had fewer and lower-paying endorsement opportunities than men—the top 20 women made an estimated $191 million off the field this year, compared with $624 million for the men—but the big difference is on the field, with playing salaries, bonuses and prize money. The WNBA’s “supermax” salary, for instance, was $241,984 this season. In the NBA, by contrast, 41 players this season will eclipse Gauff’s total earnings with their salaries alone, according to contract database Spotrac. The gap is less stark in individual sports, but there are still disparities. In golf, Thitikul broke the LPGA Tour’s 17-year-old single-season prize money record in 2024 with $6.1 million, less than what 33 men from the PGA Tour and LIV Golf made this year. And in tennis, while the four Grand Slam tournaments now pay equal prize money to men and women, smaller tournaments don’t make the same guarantee. In all, only four of the 20 highest-paid female athletes earned more on the field than they did off it, and the top 20’s on-field sum of $68 million represented 26% of their total, the vast majority of it from tennis players. The top 20 male athletes, by comparison, made 72% of their total on the field—almost an exact inversion of the women’s ratio. The compensation discrepancy starts with revenue—women’s leagues simply have smaller pots to pay out of. But that math may be starting to change. The WNBA will reportedly receive $200 million a year in national TV money as part of the 11-year, $76 billion media agreements the NBA signed over the summer, a sixfold increase from the WNBA’s previous deal with ESPN, according to Sportico. The LPGA Tour is offering $131 million in purses across its 33 tournaments next year—a 90% increase since 2021—and the WTA Tour has pledged to achieve equal pay between male and female tennis players at combined 500- and 1000-level events by 2033. Meanwhile, the NWSL, which has been drawing investment from big names including Disney CEO Bob Iger, agreed to eliminate its draft and implement a free-agent system as part of a collective bargaining agreement announced in August. And new women’s leagues are sprouting up in hockey (the Professional Women’s Hockey League), softball (the Athletes Unlimited Softball League) and basketball (Unrivaled), among other sports. In one other promising sign for the growing financial viability of women’s pro sports, while the list of the highest-paid female athletes remains dominated by tennis, the mix of sports is getting more balanced. This year’s ranking includes three golfers, two basketball players, a soccer player, a gymnast, a freestyle skier and a badminton player. (Five years ago, the entire top 10 came from tennis.) Eleven athletes surpassed $10 million in earnings this year, according to Forbes estimates—the first time there have been more than eight—and 17 members of the ranking’s top 20 are under 30 years old. In fact, the median age is just 26—meaning these athletes’ best years may still be ahead of them. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Gauff served as Team USA’s co-flag bearer at the Paris Olympics’ opening ceremony in July, and while her level of play dipped a bit over the summer, she was back at her best in the fall, winning the China Open and the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. That last victory came with a $4.8 million check, but the 20-year-old star makes even more money off the court, where she recently added hair-care brand Carol’s Daughter, Fanatics and Naked Juice to a list of long-term partners that now goes 11 deep. She also appeared on the cover of Wheaties boxes during the U.S. Open, honoring her title run in Flushing Meadows a year earlier. Robert Prange/getty images Świątek led the 2023 female athletes ranking with an estimated $23.9 million, and she finishes this year within $100,000 of that total, with Lancôme and Lego joining her robust sponsor portfolio. But the 23-year-old also experienced turbulence, splitting with her coach and losing the No. 1 singles ranking after 50 straight weeks in the top spot. Most notably, news broke in November that she had tested positive for a banned substance three months earlier. However, the International Tennis Integrity Agency ruled that the result was unintentional—caused by contamination of melatonin she was taking for sleeping issues—and issued her only a one-month suspension. Jamie Squire/Getty Images Gu has lucrative endorsement deals with Western brands including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and new addition Porsche as well as Chinese brands such as Anta sportswear, Bosideng jackets and Mengniu Dairy. With her 16th World Cup victory this month, she moved back into a tie for the career freeskiing lead, but some Chinese social media users have accused Gu, who was born in San Francisco and represents her mother’s native China in competition, of being “unpatriotic” and “two-faced.” “In the past five years, I’ve represented China in 41 international competitions and have won 39 medals for China,” Gu shot back in a post on short-video app Douyin. “What have you done for the country?” Daniel Kopatsch/getty images In the past two years, Zheng had won the WTA Tour’s Newcomer of the Year and Most Improved Player Awards, but she raised her game in 2024, reaching the Australian Open final and winning gold in singles at the Paris Olympics. The success has made her a huge star in her native China, with Audi, milk tea chain Chagee, Lancôme and phone maker Vivo among the brands signing her as an ambassador. Her quick rise has already prompted comparisons to her countrywoman Li Na, who won two majors and appeared in the top 10 of the female athletes earnings ranking from 2011 to 2014. WANG ZHAO/getty images Sabalenka jumped ahead of her rival Iga Świątek to capture tennis’ No. 1 ranking and claimed the WTA Player of the Year Award after winning the Australian Open and the U.S. Open, along with two other tournaments. She also led the tour with $9.7 million in prize money, edging out Coco Gauff’s $9.4 million. Off the court, she picked up endorsement deals with Audemars Piguet watches, Master & Dynamic headphones and açaí bowl chain Oakberry. Robert Prange/getty images Osaka returned to the court on the first day of the year after missing all of 2023 as she gave birth to her first child. It wasn’t easy for the four-time major champion, who wrote in a powerful Instagram post in August, “My biggest issue is that I don’t feel like I’m in my body.” But she managed to play in 19 events after struggling with injuries in recent years and pushed her singles ranking back up to No. 58, from a low of No. 833 during her layoff. Osaka also still has more than a dozen sponsors in her stable and is a cofounder of production company Hana Kuma, which is working with golf’s LPGA Tour to create campaigns around its athletes and is developing an anime series that will include Osaka as a voice actor. Robert Prange/getty images Raducanu still has a slew of lucrative partnerships she signed in the wake of her victory as an 18-year-old at the 2021 U.S. Open, with brands including British Airways, Dior and HSBC, but she has been plagued by injuries, illnesses and inconsistency in the years since her breakout. The world’s 57th-ranked player heads into 2025 with a new fitness coach—the well-regarded Yutaka Nakamura, who previously worked with Maria Sharapova and Naomi Osaka—as she remains on the hunt for her second career WTA tournament win. Douglas P. DeFelice/Stringer/getty images Korda tied an LPGA Tour record this year with five straight tournament victories and, despite a neck injury, finished 2024 with seven titles, the tour’s best total since 2011. Her $4.4 million in LPGA prize money also surpassed the tour record—although she herself was topped this year by Jeeno Thitikul’s $6.1 million—and she won the LPGA’s Player of the Year Award to go with the No. 1 ranking. Away from the course, Korda added Tumi to the best sponsorship portfolio in women’s golf. Aaron Doster/Stringer/Getty Images Williams played just two competitive events this year—each a first-round loss—as she winds down a legendary career that has included seven Grand Slam singles titles. But while endorsement deals tend to revolve around tennis players’ rankings, the 44-year-old is not your average No. 977 player. She is active on the speaking circuit, making six figures per engagement, and she stays busy as an ambassador and entrepreneur. Palazzo, an AI-powered interior design platform, is among her latest projects, and she was the model for a one-of-a-kind Barbie doll created as part of the toy’s 65th anniversary celebration. Tom Weller/VOIGT/getty images After a case of “the twisties” knocked her out of Olympic competition in Tokyo in 2021, Biles made a triumphant return to the Summer Games this year, winning three gold medals and a silver in Paris. Her comeback was chronicled in the Netflix docuseries Simone Biles Rising, and she took a victory lap with a series of exhibitions called the Gold Over America Tour—or GOAT, in recognition of her now-unquestioned status as gymnastics’ greatest of all-time. Robert Prange/getty images Pegula won two tournaments this year, in Berlin and Toronto, but two losses in New York also qualified as highlights. At the U.S. Open in September, she advanced past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam for the first time, eventually falling to Aryna Sabalenka in the final. And this month, she faced rising American star Emma Navarro in an exhibition at Madison Square Garden in front of a crowd of more than 19,000. “The New York crowds are just different,” she told the New York Post ahead of that match. Mike Stobe/Stringer/Getty Images Thitikul earned a $1 million bonus for winning the Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a season-long competition on the LPGA Tour, and she claimed the biggest victory of her young career at the CME Group Tour Championship in November. The 21-year-old already had a long and impressive résumé, however. At 14, she was the youngest golfer ever to win a Ladies European Tour event, at a 2017 tournament in her native Thailand, and she reached No. 1 in the world rankings as a 19-year-old LPGA rookie in 2022. G Fiume/Getty Images Clark, recently honored as a member of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and 100 Most Powerful Women lists, went from a record-breaking college star to a record-breaking WNBA rookie with the Indiana Fever in 2024, setting the league’s single-season mark for assists. Her growing list of partners includes Nike, State Farm and Wilson Sporting Goods, and she appeared in the ESPN+ docuseries Full Court Press during her senior season at the University of Iowa. Robert Prange/getty images Paolini was one-half of the WTA Tour’s doubles team of the year, alongside Sara Errani, after they reached the French Open final and won Olympic gold. But the late-blooming 28-year-old was just as successful in singles, finishing as the runner-up at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon, rising to No. 4 in the year-end rankings and leading Italy to the Billie Jean King Cup title. She has momentum off the court as well, recently partnering with Intesa Sanpaolo and Italgas. Robert Prange/getty images Rybakina had to pull out of two Wimbledon warm-up tournaments, the Paris Olympics and the U.S. Open because of illnesses and injuries, and she missed the WTA Tour’s entire Asian swing in the fall. But the 25-year-old, who was born in Russia and represents Kazakhstan, returned for the WTA Finals and scored a round-robin victory over No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. Rybakina has now won six of her last eight matches against top-ranked players. Ira L. Black - Corbis/getty images Days after revealing that she was pregnant with her second child, Morgan retired from professional soccer, playing 13 minutes in her final game with San Diego Wave FC in September. She ends her career with two World Cup titles and an Olympic gold medal and ranks fifth in U.S. women’s national team history with 123 goals. Also a prolific pitchwoman and investor, Morgan acquired stakes this year in Unrivaled, the forthcoming women’s pro basketball league, and Classic Football Shirts, which sells vintage soccer jerseys. Shi Tang/Stringer/Getty Images Sindhu’s name recognition may be lacking in the U.S., but she is a huge marketing star in her native India and is making her sixth appearance on Forbes’ female athlete earnings ranking. A two-time Olympic medalist and the 2019 badminton world champion, Sindhu led the Indian women to their first title at the Badminton Asia Team Championships in February and served as her country’s co-flag bearer at the Paris Summer Games’ opening ceremony, although she was ousted from the tournament in the round of 16. Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Fernandez is No. 31 in women’s singles, which represents her best year-end ranking since 2021, when she unexpectedly reached the U.S. Open final against Emma Raducanu. In August, the 22-year-old Canadian beat Elena Rybakina in the second round at the Cincinnati Open, her first victory over a top-five player since her magical run in Flushing Meadows saw her knock off Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina and Aryna Sabalenka. Off the court, Fernandez remains a star in Canada with more than a dozen long-term partners, signing this year with enterprise software company SAP and Folgers Coffee. Paul Ellis/getty images After falling two games short of a WNBA championship in 2023, Ionescu got her ring this year with the New York Liberty, following a gold-medal performance with Team USA at the Paris Olympics. She also nearly pulled off an upset win over Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA’s All-Star Weekend in February. That isn’t Ionescu’s first time crossing over to the men’s game: Her signature shoe from Nike has been worn by NBA players including the Boston Celtics’ Jrue Holiday, the New York Knicks’ Jalen Brunson and the Indiana Pacers’ Tyrese Haliburton. Luke Walker/Stringer/Getty Images In January, Ko claimed her first LPGA Tour title since 2022, and she followed it up with two more, including the Women’s British Open. She now ranks fourth on the LPGA’s career official prize money list with $20,143,981, and with another year like this one, she will pass Annika Sorenstam ($22,583,693) for the tour record. Ko also won the women’s golf tournament at the Paris Games, giving her a complete set of Olympic medals—gold, silver (from 2016) and bronze (2021). The Forbes ranking of the world’s highest-paid female athletes reflects earnings from the calendar year 2024.

62,Forbes,Red Card For FIFA’s Saudi World Cup,https://www.forbes.com/sites/minkyworden/2024/12/09/red-card-for-fifas-saudi-world-cup/,1156,Minky Worden,2024-12-09,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Emir and President of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (L), Gianni Infantino (SUI) FIFA ... [+] President, (M), Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud (R) in the group A match in Al Bayt Stadium in Doha, Qatar on November 20, 2022. No one can predict which team will win the Men’s World Cup soccer championship in 2034. But based on current conditions, we know the biggest losers will be the millions of migrant workers subject to egregious abuses while building stadiums, transit, infrastructure, and other facilities for host country Saudi Arabia over the next decade. On December 11, the 211 national members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) will hold a vote in an “Extraordinary Congress” to decide who will host the 2034 tournament. The conclusion is already known because Saudi Arabia is the only bidder and has received a glowing score from FIFA in the evaluation of its bid. FIFA doesn’t disclose how much it profits from granting its flagship tournament to countries with dismal human rights records. Those most affected by this decision— Saudi Arabia’s 13.4 million migrant workers, Saudi citizens, players, fans and journalists—have no vote. FIFA and its Saudi government partners boasted recently that Saudi Arabia’s evaluation score of 419.8 out of 500 is “the highest ever score in FIFA World Cup history.” The deeply flawed FIFA evaluation process further downplayed systemic human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia with a “medium risk” rating. FIFA gave this “highest ever score” to a country with no labor unions, no press freedom, and a government that is deeply repressive and punishes any dissent. “We cannot say that Saudi Arabia is a ‘medium risk’ country, given that it has become a pure police state,” said Lina al-Hathloul, Head of Monitoring and Advocacy at ALQST For Human Rights, whose sister Loujain was jailed and tortured for advocating for women’s right to drive. This month FIFA leaders also rejected the organization’s own independent report that confirms FIFA “has a responsibility” to compensate families of thousands of migrant workers who died building FIFA’s last World Cup, in Qatar in 2022. Like Qatar, Saudi Arabia operates under the abusive labor sponsorship system known as kafala, where migrant workers pay large recruitment fees, often have passports taken and wages stolen by employers, and cannot change jobs or leave the country freely. Labor unions, strikes and protests are banned. Saudi authorities do not adequately protect migrant workers from dangerous conditions such as extreme heat. The unprecedented scale of Saudi World Cup plans makes the potential for labor rights catastrophes greater even than for the Qatar World Cup. The Saudi hosting documents promise to construct—in the deadly desert heat, as in Qatar—11 new and 4 refurbished stadiums,185,000 new hotel rooms, and to carry out airport, road and rail construction. This infrastructure deficit will rest entirely on the backs of migrant workers to build. Many of these World Cup projects will be accomplished with funding from the Saudi state-run $925 billion Public Investment Fund and from oil and gas behemoth Aramco, FIFA’s new major worldwide partner. The hundreds of billions of dollars in construction come with a high human cost. A new Human Rights Watch report found that 884 migrant workers from Bangladesh died in Saudi Arabia between January and July 2024—a six month period. Eighty percent of these deaths were un-investigated, attributed to “natural causes,” and not eligible for compensation. Human Rights Watch wrote to FIFA President Gianni Infantino on November 4, 2024, documenting widespread labor abuses on giga-projects in Saudi Arabia that will be part of the World Cup infrastructure. FIFA has not responded. Winning the right to host is an effort championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has made clear that the FIFA World Cup is a centerpiece of the Saudi national sportswashing strategy to project a reformist image of the country, while covering up its human rights abuses. “If sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by 1 percent, then we will continue doing sportswashing,” the de-facto Saudi leader said in an interview with Fox News last year. “I don’t care.” People walk past a banner showing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, outside a mall in Jeddah, ... [+] Saudi Arabia, December 6, 2019. But FIFA should care. Awarding Saudi Arabia the World Cup violates FIFA’s own human rights rules. In 2016, facing a corruption crisis, FIFA put in place specific human rights standards for itself and countries hosting the games—including protections against forced labor. These reforms were supposed to keep the tournament away from the worst human-rights violators. FIFA also pledged “an ongoing due diligence process to identify, address, evaluate and communicate the risks of involvement with adverse human rights impacts,” promising to “make every effort to uphold its international human rights responsibilities.” Yet not a single migrant worker, victim of human rights crimes, torture survivor, jailed women’s rights defender, or Saudi civil society member was consulted for FIFA’s supposedly independent human rights assessment. FIFA’s “Bid Evaluation Report” doesn’t even mention the historic forced labor complaint against the Saudi government filed by the trade union BWI at the International Labour Organization (ILO) in June of this year. A similar complaint about Qatar in 2014 spurred labor reforms in the country, although too late to help thousands of migrant workers who died. In 2023, FIFA was forced to cancel the sponsorship it sold to the Saudi state-run tourism company “Visit Saudi,” after protests by women players. In October, more than 100 top women players published an open letter protesting FIFA’s lucrative sponsorship deal with the Saudi state oil giant Aramco. Already, two United States senators have called for FIFA to pick a different host for the 2034 World Cup. FIFA needs to cancel the vote and back athletes and human rights over profiteering from Saudi sportswashing. Every sponsor, business, broadcaster, and national team associated with the Saudi World Cup will be tainted by widespread labor and other abuses unless wholesale, urgent human rights reforms are implemented. FIFA’s decision to award Saudi Arabia the 2034 World Cup is an unforgivable betrayal of basic human rights that risks migrant workers’ lives. It deserves a red card. One Community.

63,Forbes,Holiday Flight Canceled? The New USDOT Airline Refund Rule Can Help,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/11/26/holiday-flight-cancelled-the-new-usdot-airline-refund-rule-can-help/,1364,Marisa Garcia,2024-11-26,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Travelers check-in for their flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, ... [+] on December 22, 2023, ahead of the upcoming Christmas holiday. US airlines are gearing up for record traffic this holiday season, having beefed up staffing in the hopes of avoiding a repeat of last Christmas's operational meltdown. Authorities expect more than 267,000 flights between December 20 and 26, with a peak of nearly 49,000 flights on December 22, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) If you’re flying during the holiday season, knowing how the new U.S. Department of Transportation airline refund rule might apply is essential. This new rule ensures airlines compensate consumers fairly when air travel fails. However, it has some limitations. You should not assume your travel disruption will automatically qualify for a refund. You should also consider how accepting an airline’s alternative travel arrangements might impact your rights. HOUSTON, TEXAS - DECEMBER 21: Merrie Monzingo, left, dances with United Airlines employee Peaches ... [+] Sullivan as she gets ready to check in at the C Terminal at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Thursday, Dec. 21, 2023, in Houston. United expects more than 50,000 passengers, operating more than 400 flights a day through Houston, during the holiday season, a United spokesperson said. (Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) You will qualify for an automatic refund if an airline cancels your flight and does not rebook you on a new flight or offer compensation for the cancelation. That compensation can be a flight voucher for future travel or a loyalty reward credit such as points or miles. However, you will not get your money back for the trip once you accept that alternate compensation. You will also qualify for a refund if you do not accept the airline’s rebooking. You should consider whether the airline’s alternative travel plans are convenient and practical for you. Sometimes, you may be better off booking a new ticket with a different airline and getting your refund from the airline that canceled your original flight. While many airlines will offer passengers additional accommodations, such as hotel or meal vouchers and transportation, during service failures, you should ask for details before accepting the alternate itinerary. ORLANDO, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 22: Passengers are seen at the Frontier Airlines ticket ... [+] counter at Orlando International Airport ahead of the Christmas holiday travel on December 22, 2023 in Orlando, Florida. According to the travel organization AAA estimates 7.5 million people will travel by air, surpassing 2019's record of 7.3 million passengers. (Photo by Paul Hennesy/Anadolu via Getty Images) Along the same lines, you are entitled to a refund if the airline changes your original itinerary significantly, including the flight schedule, connections, destination or service. The U.S. DOT defines “significant” changes as follows: The rule also applies when the airline downgrades your travel class. For example, if you paid for a first-class ticket and are asked to fly in economy class. This August, rapper Juvenile, whose legal name is Terius Gray, walked off an American Airlines flight after being downgraded. When the cabin crew on his New Orleans to Dallas flight informed him of the seat change, Gray took to social media to express his disappointment. His wife, who was traveling with him, retained her first-class seat. American Airlines explained that an aircraft change led to a shortage of first-class seats and prompted an automatic downgrade of randomly selected passengers. The angry rapper took a flight with a different airline. Delta Air Lines earned the displeasure of actor and K-pop star Hyeri last year for downgrading her first-class ticket to economy class on a U.S. domestic flight without issuing a refund. Delta explained the downgrade was also due to an aircraft change. However, with the new U.S. DOT rule, Juvenile and Hyeri would both qualify for an automatic refund and so would any passengers going through the same thing, celebrities or not. The U.S. DOT also considers the needs of disabled travelers. A change is significant if it includes connecting at different airports or flying on other aircraft that are “less accessible or accommodating” to a passenger’s disability. The airline may offer other compensation for any significant changes. However, once you accept that offer, you will not qualify for a refund. Los Angeles, CA -  Airliners taxi to their gates at LAX on Wednesday, Dec. 27, 2023. Travel experts ... [+] say this weekend will produce a surge in air passengers as people head home from their holiday trips.  (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) With the U.S. DOT’s new refund rule, you may be eligible to get back any additional services you paid for when booking your ticket under certain circumstances. For example, you can qualify for a refund of whatever you paid for checked baggage. You must file a mishandled baggage claim with the airline at the airport so there is a record of the service failure. If the airline fails to deliver your bags within 12 hours from when your plane was at the gate for a domestic flight and by 15-30 hours after your plane reached the gate for an international flight, you qualify for a baggage fee refund. The rule gives airlines more time to deliver luggage depending on how long the flight is, but 30 hours is the upper limit. If you paid for in-flight Wi-Fi but the service doesn’t work, you will also qualify for a service refund. If you paid for a specific seat and were asked to sit elsewhere, you qualify for a refund of the seat selection fee. You may also be eligible for a refund of any payment for in-flight entertainment if the service is unavailable. It’s important to understand that these ancillary refunds only apply when an airline charges you for the service. You are not due automatic compensation during the failure of any free Wi-Fi or in-flight entertainment included in your base fare. Also, these service failures do not obligate airlines to offer a full refund of the value of your ticket so long as the flight takes place according to the original booking. Jessica Chastain suffered social media backlash in October after failing to understand this limitation. The Oscar-winning actress contacted JetBlue on X, formerly Twitter, asking for a refund because the in-flight entertainment did not work during a six-hour flight. The airline offered the actress a $15.00 voucher for the inconvenience, but Chastain felt this wasn’t enough. “Thank you @JetBlue for your $15.00 credit. My flight was $1,500 and the credit is 1/100 of the money I paid you,” Chastain posted. An airline representative on X expressed regret, but Chastain replied, “I understand but I spent $1500 on the flight and so did my husband. There should be some flight credit or something since I have a TrueBlue account and have been a loyal customer.” Whether or not you can relate to Chastain on this point, the reality is that airlines only make around $6.15 on average per passenger carried in profit, as reported by the International Air Transport Association. Everything else goes to cover the costs of getting you there. Still, travelers in the U.S. now have more rights when traveling by air. You can make wiser choices, saving money and hassle, if your holiday travel plans go awry. One Community.

64,Forbes,Best Las Vegas Sports Bars On Or Near The Strip,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2024/12/13/best-las-vegas-sports-bars-on-or-near-the-strip/,2525,Larry Olmsted,2024-12-13,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Sports have always been big in Las Vegas, but in recent years spectator sporting events have become a huge draw, and sports tourism here has never been hotter. Interest in sports betting has exploded nationwide, and that carries over in a big way to visitors to Las Vegas, who want to place bets and see the action. For all these reasons, there is high demand from visitors for great places to watch, without venturing too far from the casino hotels they stay and play at, and these are the best Las Vegas sports bars on or near the Strip. Las Vegas has continually pushed the boundaries of tourism and re-invented itself for different audience, all while growing visitation and years of record-breaking tourism. At various times the drivers were food, entertainment, and most recently, sports. For more on this phenomenon, read my Forbes story, “Best City For Sports Fans: Why Las Vegas Has Something For Every Taste And Budget.” As recently as seven years ago, Vegas was the largest U.S. city without a team in any of the four major pro sports, but since then they have landed the NHL, NFL and MLB in rapid-fire succession, as well as a WNBA team and franchises in everything from pro lacrosse to arena football, plus high-profile minor league teams in baseball (AAA), hockey (AHL) and basketball (NBA G League). The latest persistent rumor is of an NBA expansion team coming, which would complete the city’s pro sports Grand Slam. The city has also quietly hosted the nation’s biggest rodeo, the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), for more than three decades, with annual average attendance well over 160,000 since a break for COVID in 2020. There is also an annual PGA Tour golf tournament. The recent media hoopla around the arrival of Formula 1—the biggest event of any kind in the city—has overshadowed the fact that Las Vegas is home to two different annual races in NASCAR—the most popular auto racing series in the country. Las Vegas has always been big on one-off spectacles, from heavyweight fights to stunts to special events, and this remains the case, but the ante has been upped with the growth of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), often holding the biggest bouts here, and made for TV pro golf events such as The Match. Just before Thanksgiving, the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix was held, and according to Formula 1 spokespeople, attendance was over 300,000. This year also saw the first Super Bowl here, and a new Major League Baseball stadium is under way on the Strip (Las Vegas Boulevard). Live sports have become a huge magnet for tourism, but it’s worth noting that Las Vegas is also a hugely popular destination for marquee sporting events—even when they are held someplace else. The Super Bowl had never been in Vegas before this year, yet for decades it has been one of the busiest tourism days in the city. The Final Four has never been held here, yet all of March Madness is a huge attendance draw, as are the Kentucky Derby and Breeders Cup, baseball playoffs and World Series, the NBA Finals, and every four years, World Cup soccer. Recently a college friend asked me for Las Vegas travel advice, as have dozens of other acquaintances over the years. He was planning a guys’ sports trip, and they basically wanted to spend a weekend in Vegas watching college basketball and football on Saturday and NFL football on Sunday, while drinking and eating and betting the whole time. He had not been to Vegas in a very long time and imagined his group sitting in the sports book scoring free drinks while watching games and hitting the betting windows. He asked me which sports book would be best. My answer? None of them. Sports books have changed a lot in the 30-plus years I have been writing about all things Las Vegas. Free drinks are much harder to come by than in the past, especially for sports other than horse racing, and often require substantial bets just to get a free drink ticket, which is often good only for domestic beer or a well drink. Other options are generally overpriced, as is food, which is usually subpar compared to the many other excellent offerings outside the sports book. Most of the books are not especially comfortable, especially for larger groups that want to be able to chat and enjoy each other’s company, the way they would at a buddy’s home. The best seating usually requires reservations, often limited to established members of casino loyalty programs, and the more elaborate books that have living room style boxes usually have reservation fees and/or high food and drink minimums. Finally, while they might have all the big games on multiple TVs, they also have horse racing from half a dozen tracks, auto racing, and every other pro sport event happening anywhere, a huge distraction for fans of a particular game. But the biggest change is that every major cariso has gone to an app-based virtual sports book, so you can bet from anywhere in the casino—or anywhere in Nevada, while there are still often long lines at the actual betting windows. Your phone now frees you from the tyranny of the sports book as a bettor, so why not also break free of the food, beverage, viewing and creature comfort constraints? Even if you have a preferred casino or casino company, you can visit any sports bar in the city and still easily place bets there. For sports fans who like good food, drink and watching the games they want to watch, whether they are betting or not, a sports bar is usually the better answer. It is often a better buy as well. The best have plenty of TVs, and not only is what you want going to be on, you can probably have the TV nearest to you tuned to the game of your choice. The food menu is generally better, often much better, and in many cases cheaper. Ditto for adult beverages. Service is almost always going to be significantly better than in the sports book, where trying to get a drink can be a full-time job. And unlike the casino sports books, where it’s the same all the time, many sports bars run specials and often offer discounts and deals on the most popular game days—like every Sunday in NFL season. Finally there’s the physical comfort. You can block a table or seating area just for your group and hang out, just as you would in your living room at home, but in a way that is often impossible in the rows of seats and high tops most sports books offer. Yes, there are few that have boxes with couch style seating and their own TVs, mirrored on the poolside cabanas now the norm in the city, but just like those, these tend to have very high upfront costs and/or minimums, and a good sports bar is going to be a better deal, and often better in every way. If saving money is your sole rationale, there are lots of value-focused local options off the Strip. In addition, the more local-centric casinos, like the Station properties, have very good sports bars, as does the sports-centric Circa in Downtown “Old” Las Vegas. But you probably did not go to Vegas to do everything on the cheap, and if you are staying in one of the major casino resorts on the Strip, which is likely, just about every one of those has a sports bar you can enjoy without leaving, taking a ride share or taxi. Plus, you’ll still have easy access to the sports book if you want to put down a bet without using an app. Also, many take reservations without requiring you to have any casino or gambling status. But some are better than others, and these are my favorites. This is my number one pick for several reasons. It is centrally located on the Strip and easy to walk to from just about every property, even if you are not staying at Paris. But you might want to, as the hotel just wrapped up a $100 million renovation, and is one of the best buys in town. The work included a new 750-room tower with some of the largest standard rooms on the Strip. Beer Park is mostly al fresco, on a terrace overlooking the Strip, with outside access via one a staircase directly from the sidewalk, plus easy access from inside the casino resort. Unlike many Vegas bars and restaurants where you have to wander through the vast property after arriving, you can be seated at Beer Park one minute after reaching the front of Paris. There is also indoor seating, but I love the outside, where tables are semi-covered and have heaters in the winter and misters in the summer. There are TVs everywhere, it’s spacious, service is friendly and efficient, the food and drink menu is extensive and reasonable, and everything I have had there has been quite good. It is elevated bar food with things like smoked brisket sliders, very good wings and excellent burgers. They have a very extensive draft beer selection, and always offer 4-beer flights you create yourself. They have tables for two, four, six and eight you can reserve for game days, and larger parties can combine in advance, for instance, a table for four and eight for a dozen people. Bookings carry a reasonable food and beverage minimum spend you would likely hit anyway, with no extra fees and virtually unlimited time. As an example, a Sunday NFL reservation requires a $100 per person food and beverage buy, buts that’s easy to do in three hours, and much easier to do in 12, since reservations on Sunday start at 9AM and you can keep the table through the last game of the day, usually Sunday Night Football. Thursday Night Football which is shorter, has just a $50 required spend. They are now booking the first round of the March Madness, the NCAA tournament, with a $200 per person minimum, and that’s for all day. There are packages for Saturday College, Monday Night Football, etc., and on many Saturdays and Sundays in college and pro football season they offer a buffet brunch with tons of food, including omelet station, lox and bagels, etc. for just $35, with the option of adding bottomless mimosas or a bloody Mary bar for $35 more, and that runs 9AM-2PM. Bear in mind that in Vegas, 1PM games start at 10AM, so brunch runs through the entire first round of games. The Palms isn’t on the Strip, but it’s much closer than downtown, and a very cool hotel that has undergone a lot of recent improvements. The sporting highlight here is a bit of an under the radar hidden gem, more restaurant than sports bar, though there are plenty of TVs. This is another go-to favorite spot of mine that I heartily recommend, not only because you can beat the crowds, but due to the fact that Mabel’s is run by Cleveland celebrity chef, James Beard Award winner and and cookbook author Michael Symon, a widely acclaimed meat-expert who makes some of the best barbecue in the country, and certainly among the best in Vegas, a city that has always come up surprisingly short on real deal smoked meat, especially in the casino resorts. This is by far the top choice for people who want ribs, brisket, pulled pork or such with their sports, there are more than 30 beers on tap, and the clincher is a nice slate of “Game Day Tailgate” food specials, like decadent brisket grilled cheese, a bratwurst, ribs and wings platter, and much more. There are drink specials for Monday Night Football, Thursday Night Football, and all-day Sunday Football, with more to come when football season is over. For instance, next up is a special menu and “Cowboy Tailgate” for the National Rodeo Finals (NFR) in December, something few sports bars package deals around. “When I think about the perfect game day, it’s all about great food, cold drinks, and the energy of fans cheering on their teams,” says Chef Michael Symon. “At Mabel’s, we’ve created a place where all of that comes together—amazing BBQ, a fun and welcoming atmosphere, and a menu that’s got something for everyone.” This season’s NFL deals include $5 drafts of Modelo, Bud Light and 805 Firestone, $5 Jameson, $10 Codigo Tequila Margaritas, discounted beer pitchers, buckets and towers, and even all-you-can-drink mimosas for $32. This is half the price—or less—of what you would pay at most sports books, with much better food in a great setting, and if you want an easy place to go watch sports that is also a top dining pick, this is it. Eight Cigar Lounge, Resorts World Las Vegas This is my hidden gem pick in one of my very favorite casino resorts, and a luxury experience—coupled with some shocking deals on drinks. Eight Cigar Lounge is where many icons of professional sports go to watch professional sports, and those spotted indulging here have included NBA legends Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, MLB star Alex “A-Rod” Rodriguez, NFL Hall of Famer Charles Woodson, and WNBA champs Alysha Clark and Chelsea Gray. Eight is a fancy cigar retailer with walk-in humidor on one side, and next door is the bar and lounge. It is upscale, with plush seating and big screen TVs, more cocktail lounge than sports bar, and also has an expansive outdoor terrace, a Las Vegas rarity. But in addition to the menu of premium cigars, they have crazy football deals like $6 Coronas (or a bucket of six for $30), $14 Belvedere vodka and Voclan tequila cocktails, and a Hennessy cognac Old Fashioned for $18. The food is by highly-acclaimed Chef Nicole Brisson of Brezza, just down the hall, which is the best fine dining Italian eatery in Las Vegas (no small thing with so much stiff competition) and one of the best in the U.S. She rolls out elevated game day snacks such as Lollipop Buffalo Wings and much more, and does it on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays in football season. Other sports can be viewed here in style, and it is THE place to go for games of hometown NHL heroes the Las Vegas Golden Knights. This is a classy yet surprisingly affordable choice, but reservations are highly recommended. Read more about what makes Resorts World and its dining, including Brezza, so special here at Forbes. Also in Resorts World, this one is sort of a hybrid, a sports bar at the sports book—and I wish there were more like it. You get the sports bar vibe and comforts, lots of TVs, better food and extensive menu, you can make reservations, and the betting is right next door. But while its reasonably priced, there are no Game Day specials or Happy Hour deals. Dawg House is a top pick for those who don’t use a betting app and want access to the live windows. Everyone knows that Emmy-award winning chef and TV star Guy Fieri is “The Mayor of Flavortown,” but not everyone knows that he is a huge sports fan and UNLV alum. Nor does everyone know that the former Bally’s casino resort was rebranded as the Horseshoe, in honor of the original Binion’s Horseshoe Downtown, which no longer exists. Binion’s was the birthplace of the famed World Series of Poker, currently held at the Horseshoe and Paris next door. Now that we’ve cleared that up, Fieri opened Flavortown Sports Kitchen, a new addition to his restaurant empire, this summer in the Horseshoe, with dozens of HD screens and his uniquely bold take on American bar standards, including a slate of jumbo burgers, the signature “Winner, Winner Chicken dinner” (fried), and his famous Trash Can nachos with smoked brisket. There is a big island bar with regular TVs, a massive sports book-style video wall for the tables, and a bookable MVP Lounge with living room-style couch seating. With a $25 booking fee, it’s one of the best such deals in town. Game day specials or Happy Hours are not a thing here currently, but food and drink is still a good deal and better quality then most sports books, and they do have discounted group food and drink packages for a crowd (14 or more), starting with a $100 per person four course menu. This two-level rooftop spot is a pure sports bar that is right on the Strip but not in a hotel. It sits directly across Las Vegas Boulevard from the Park MGM resort, and as its name suggests, BrewDog has more than 30 beers on tap—and an onsite microbrewery. They take reservations and have a huge menu that runs the gamut from breakfast to bar snacks to live fire cooked steaks and seafood. Every sporting event is given priority here, and it is especially popular for the Golden Knights—especially with a 25% discount for anyone wearing Knights gear on game days. While there are no other game day-specific deals, they do have host of specials all week long, from weekday 3-6PM Happy Hour to $5 Bloody Mary’s on Sunday mornings (during football) and all you can eat pizza and wing deals on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Many of these above options are also good places to book for the biggest days in sports, such as the Super Bowl, and often have special “Big Game” packages. But no matter what your favorite team or game is, these are some of the best Las Vegas sports bars on or near the Strip."
65,Forbes,Banana Duct-Taped To A Wall Sells For $6.2 Million At Auction,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliestoclet/2024/11/20/banana-duct-taped-to-wall-is-going-for-over-1-million-at-auction-why/,777,Natalie Stoclet,2024-11-21,Culture,NA,NA,"A yellow banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $6.2 million at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday. Let that sink in. If you’re slightly baffled, congratulations—you’re in on the punchline. That’s exactly what Maurizio Cattelan, the artist and provocateur behind Comedian, intended. Cattelan has long been a master of challenging the norms of the art world. From his golden toilet (America) to his suspended taxidermy animals, he’s built a career on art that’s as much about the reaction as the object itself. The real star of this artwork isn’t the banana; it’s you and your reaction. And let’s face it, since its debut at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2019, this piece has driven the art world bananas. As a kid, I watched my mom haggle in the bustling markets of Tunisia and Morocco, where we lived. There, I learned a simple truth: the value of a good is what someone is willing to pay for it. But Comedian operates beyond supply and demand. Its power lies in making us question the very idea of value, especially in the art world, where meaning and absurdity often share a wall. What makes this banana different from the one browning on your counter? The intention behind it. A banana becomes art when it’s duct-taped to a wall in galleries like Perrotin and White Cube, its value secured not by materials but by the concept it represents. Buyers aren’t purchasing produce—they’re buying the idea, along with the rights to recreate Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian as an authentic work. Cattelan once said, “Comedian was not a joke; it was a sincere commentary on what we value.” He forces us to confront how we define value and meaning by turning simple materials into art. It’s absurd, yes, but also profound—a slapstick critique of the question: what makes something art? That question lies at the heart of the subjective theory of value, the long-debated economic principle from the late 19th century. Pioneered by thinkers like Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, and Léon Walras, it maintains that the value of an object isn’t fixed by labor, time, or materials but is determined by context and perception. A bottle of water costs a dollar at the corner store, but stranded in the middle of the desert, it becomes priceless. Comedian, by selling first for $120,000 in 2019 and now selling to crypto entrepreneurs Justin Sun, agrees with this subjective theory of value, highlighting the sometimes arbitrary nature of art pricing. The value of Comedian lies in the meaning and discourse it generates—but it’s certainly not the first work of art to do so. In 1917, Marcel Duchamp turned a porcelain urinal into art with Fountain, challenging the traditional confines of the art world at the time. Artist’s Shit, the 1961 anti-artwork by the Italian artist Piero Manzoni, sought to do the same; the work consisted of 90 tin cans, each reportedly filled with 30 grams of feces. Damien Hirst’s shark in formaldehyde and Banksy’s self-shredding painting both tested the boundaries of art and spectacle. Like these works, Comedian doesn’t just sit on a wall—it laughs at the walls themselves. These works share a spirit of rebellion, poking at the edges of tradition and asking audiences to rethink what art is. Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian takes its place among these iconoclastic milestones. As Cattelan himself put it in an interview with The Art Newspaper in 2021, “I could sell a banana like others sell their paintings. I could play within the system, but with my rules.” Like his contemporaries and predecessors who share a legacy of art historical dissidence, the real power of Comedian isn’t in the arbitrary materials—it’s in the response it provokes. Maurizio Cattelan knew this when he said, “I am always at risk of making a fool of myself because if no one reacts to the work then it would not work.” The artwork’s success hinges entirely on how it’s received: the gasps, the laughs, the debates. Art like Comedian acts as a reflection of society’s values, simultaneously serious and ridiculous. The art world, like the artwork itself, exists in a delicate balance of elitism and absurdity, meaning and nonsense. So, do we value Comedian because of what it says about art—or because of what it says about us? Maybe, as Andy Warhol suggested, “Art is whatever you can get away with.” And maybe, we let them get away with it. By reducing the medium to something as absurdly mundane as a piece of fruit and duct tape, Comedian forces us to confront the art market’s fragile systems of value. It asks: Is the joke on the art world, the audience, or both?"
66,Forbes,‘Fortnite’ Is About To Get Flushed By ‘Skibidi Toilet’,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/12/17/fortnite-is-about-to-get-flushed-by-skibidi-toilet/,654,Dani Di Placido,2024-12-17,Culture,NA,NA,"Skins from the popular (but controversial) YouTube series ‘Skibidi Toilet’ are set to drop in ‘Fortnite,’ prompting gamers to question how on earth we got here.  Skibidi Toilet, created by Alexey Gerasimov YouTube series Skibidi Toilet will soon appear in Fortnite as a skin—the news sparked surprise, disbelief and plenty of memes from Fortnite fans. Fortnite is something of a media multiverse, a digital playground where all the popular franchises collide, from Dragon Ball to Family Guy; Skibidi Toilet’s entry to the Fortnite-verse perhaps marks its official entry into mainstream pop culture. Rumors first started appearing on X (Twitter) that Fortnite would be incorporating Skibidi Toilet as a skin— leaker SpushFNBR reported that a skin for ""Plungerman"" with a Skibidi Toilet backpack, and a Plungerman Plunger pickaxe will all drop on Fortnite. Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite, confirmed the leak on X with a few teasing emojis, including a toilet, plunger and video camera, with the date ""12.18.2024."" Skibidi Toilet is an animated series featuring grotesque, singing toilet people that are engaged in a destructive battle with an army of mechanical men, who sometimes have cameras for heads. Skibidi Toilet has proved wildly popular on YouTube, and has leaked through to the rest of the internet, inspiring homages, fan animations, and memes. Parents have often been bewildered by the popularity of the series, but Skibidi Toilet is simpler than it seems. The series was created by Georgian animator Alexey Gerasimov, who posts each episode on his YouTube channel, DaFuq!?Boom! Gerasimov started his story with an 11-second YouTube short, featuring a head emerging from a toilet, singing remixed lyrics to a Biser King song (which was originally sampled from a TikTok meme). That simple short went viral, encouraging Gerasimov to expand the story, until it grew into a long-running saga of a fiercely destructive war. Gerasimov has cited Michael Bay’s Transformers films, as well as his own recurring nightmares, as major inspirations for his series. From the very beginning, Skibidi Toilet has been created using Valve's Source Filmmaker, an animation and editing tool which is filled with assets from Valve games, such as Half-Life. After the leaks were confirmed by Epic, fans reacted with hyperbolic horror, as though Fortnite embracing Skibidi Toilet was another example of internet “brainrot” leaking through to the mainstream. Others questioned if the licensing deal could even go through at all, seeing as several Skibidi Toilet characters were built using Valve’s assets from other games. It’s unclear if Fortnite will be altering the appearance of those Skibidi Toilet characters, but the leering faces of Skibidi Toilet might be altered at some point regardless, as there are plans to adapt the series into a cinematic blockbuster franchise in the near future. In an ironic twist of fate, Michael Bay is said to be involved in the adaptation of the series, along with former Paramount president Adam Goodman, who reckons that Skibidi Toilet “could be the next Transformers or could be a Marvel universe.” Whatever Skibidi Toilet grows into, it’s become big enough now to enter Fortnite, which has become the entry point for many younger gamers to encounter major pop culture icons.

67,Forbes,Jamie Foxx Reveals Brain Bleed At 55. A Neurologist Explains Stroke Risks In Younger People,https://www.forbes.com/sites/milletienne/2024/12/11/jamie-foxx-reveals-surprise-brain-bleed-but-strokes-in-younger-patients-are-rising/,1353,Mill Etienne,2024-12-11,Entertainment,NA,NA,"Jamie Foxx shared with an audience that he has recovered from a life threatening brain bleed in ... [+] April 2023. The brain bleed was marked by a severe headache followed by amnesia for 20 days. He has completed a successful rehabilitation process. (Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Oscar winner Jamie Foxx opened up during his Netflix special that the mysterious illness he suffered last year was a brain bleed. The young, healthy actor was surprised he experienced a stroke, but there has been a steady rise in young and middle-aged adults in the United States experiencing brain bleeds. For example, a study by Houston Methodist Hospital found an 11% increase in intracerebral hemorrhage strokes from 2004 to 2018. With such a rapid rise in brain bleeds among these demographics, it’s important for the public to be aware of the risks and signs of stroke and for the medical community to institute strategies to reverse this alarming trend of disabling strokes among younger populations. Foxx explained that he could have easily overlooked his symptoms. While filming Back In Action in Atlanta in April 2023, he had a bad headache, asked a friend for an aspirin and had no recollection of what happened next, he recalled on stage during the stand-up special What Had Happened Was...  His sister took him to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated and diagnosed with a brain bleed. Foxx had no memory for the following 20 days and, after waking up, required the use of a wheelchair and went through an intense rehabilitation program. An ICH stroke, what Jamie Foxx experienced, means a vessel in or around the brain has ruptured. There are many types of brain bleeds; depending on what caused it, the intervention may differ. These are typically due to high blood pressure, aneurysms, head trauma or an abnormal tangle of vessels known as arteriovenous malformation. Although this type of stroke only accounts for 13% of strokes in the U.S., ICH strokes can be disabling or fatal. Aspirin and other blood-thinning medications can make these patients worse, which is why a clear diagnosis is important before initiating treatment. Most strokes are not brain bleeds; 87% are ischemic strokes, which is a blockage in a blood vessel that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the brain. If a patient gets to the hospital early enough, there are clot-busting medications that can reverse this type of stroke, and in some cases, the doctors can perform a procedure called thrombectomy to remove the clot. A stroke can happen to anyone at any time, but there are steps people can take to lower their risk. Being aware of how to prevent brain bleeds is important given its increasing impact on our society, often taking young people out of the work force. ""I think it is important to recognize that the two principal preventable causes of brain hemorrhages are trauma and high blood pressure,"" says neurosurgeon Dr. Jeffrey Oppenheim, my colleague from WMCHealth's Good Samaritan Hospital. ""Ways to avoid head trauma include wearing seatbelts in cars and helmets on bicycles.” Fall prevention can also prevent brain bleeds, especially in older adults. Using shower bars or shower seats, non-slip mats, avoiding rolling chairs and loose rugs and wearing supportive footwear are all helpful. A home visit with a nurse or physical therapist can help make sure the home is fall-proof. Some contractors help ensure the home has accessible features to aid in fall prevention. Smart watches can be useful in notifying emergency medical services if someone is alone and becomes incapacitated after a fall or brain bleed. High blood pressure is often seen as a silent killer because some people may not experience any symptoms until they have had a heart attack or a stroke. Many medications treat high blood pressure, but patients must first be diagnosed. ""Everyone over 30 years old should be evaluated yearly for hypertension,"" says Dr. Oppenheim. Eating a healthy, low-sodium diet can help prevent spikes in blood pressure. Additionally, ensuring a good mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins supports brain and vascular health. Regular exercise and taking medications as prescribed can all help control blood pressure. Alcohol use can also contribute to brain bleeds. Chronic alcohol use can increase the likelihood of someone having high blood pressure, and it can damage the walls of blood vessels, making them more prone to rupture. Alcohol can also damage the liver, which can lead to reduced and impaired clotting factors, known as platelets. These dysfunctional platelets can increase bleeding risk and make brain bleeds worse. Smoking can damage blood vessels and increase the likelihood of getting aneurysms in the brain, so quitting smoking can be a game-changer. Blood thinners like aspirin and oral anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding, so it is essential to follow any monitoring protocols. These should not be taken if someone has a suspected brain bleed because this can make the brain bleed worse. Other factors that may contribute to brain bleeds include blood thinners, brain tumors, bleeding disorders and the use of drugs such as cocaine. Stroke symptoms typically have a sudden onset. Whether the patient is having an ICH or an ischemic stroke, there are some common symptoms in both. ""The symptoms of a brain bleed can look a lot like an ischemic stroke but are more often associated with pain,"" says Dr. Oppenheim. ""But, you can't tell what is happening without a CT scan. So, making a rapid diagnosis at a hospital is the key to enabling treatment."" Stroke emergency awareness and recognition signs, medical procedure infographic If you think you are having a stroke, you must get to an emergency room right away as there may be time-sensitive interventions available. A great way to remember stroke symptoms is the BE FAST mnemonic: Once in the emergency room, the medical team will determine what type of stroke the patient is having and initiate the appropriate treatment. Getting to the hospital for immediate care can significantly affect stroke outcome. For example, if the blood pressure is not controlled after a brain bleed, the bleeding may increase and lead to incapacitation or death. Foxx repeatedly thanked his medical teams for the hard work they put into his care, which allowed him to return to full independence. Foxx's remarkable outcome would not have been possible had his family not acted quickly to get him to the hospital so he could get the immediate medical care he needed. He thanked his family repeatedly for their quick action. One of his first lines in the special was, ""I was fighting for my life, but now I'm here in front of you."" Indeed, he seamlessly navigated the stage, and showed how resilient the human brain can be while also demonstrating neuroplasticity, which is the brain’s ability to be shaped and molded after experiencing a trauma like a brain bleed. Make no mistake, Jamie Foxx was transparent about the rough road he’s traveled from April 2023 to the present. He may face setbacks in the future, but he has a strong social support system and inner strength that will carry him through. Anyone who suffers from brain injury should not be afraid to reinvent themselves as they see fit.

69,Forbes,Startup Dalan Animal Health Makes A Vaccine For Honeybees. Shrimp Are Next.,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/12/17/this-startup-makes-a-vaccine-for-honeybees-shrimp-are-next/,512,Amy Feldman,2024-12-17,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Dalan Animal Health cofounder and CEO Annette Kleiser How do you vaccinate a honeybee? And will beekeepers care enough to do it? Those are the questions Annette Kleiser has been wrestling since founding Dalan Animal Health in 2018. Five years after launching the startup, the government approved an oral vaccine her team created that’s designed for the world’s beekeepers to feed to worker bees, which then feed it to their queens in royal jelly. The result, strangely enough, is immunity for the queen’s offspring. Now, she’s on a mission to get as many bees vaccinated as she can — helping to safeguard not only the hives but the crops that they pollinate. “We know that the loss of insects is dramatic for this world,” Kleiser said. “We cannot survive on this planet or anywhere else without insects.” The Dalan vaccine defends against a devastating bacterial disease aptly named American Foulbrood, and Kleiser sees it as a first step toward keeping the roughly 3 million honeybee colonies in the U.S. healthy. It’s not the only disease bees can suffer from; about 50% of colonies and millions of bees die each year from a variety of ailments, including a nasty parasite called the varroa mite, pesticide poisoning, inadequate nutrition and the stress of traveling around the country to pollinate crops. Those are devastating numbers for beekeepers: “Imagine a cattle farmer losing 30 to 50% of their cattle each year,” said Matt Mulica, a senior project director at the Keystone Policy Center, which facilitates the Honey Bee Health Coalition. “How do you combat that?” Kleiser and her team at Athens, Georgia-based Dalan Animal Health believe specially designed bee vaccines are an important tool in keeping more bees alive, enabling commercial beekeepers (who may have some 5,000 to 30,000 colonies) to continue bringing them around the country so they can pollinate crops like almonds, blueberries, cucumbers and apples. “If you have an outbreak [of American Foulbrood], the spores have such resiliency that the recommended treatment is to kill all the bees and burn all the hives,” said Tom Chi, founder of At One Ventures, who invested in a $3.6 million seed round in summer 2022 as Dalan was taking its vaccine against American Foulbrood through clinical trials. “It’s catastrophic if you get it.” Kleiser, who has a Ph.D. in neurophysiology from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, discovered the research that would lead her to bee vaccines when she was working to help universities transform academic work into businesses. While visiting the University of Helsinki, she met Estonian biologist and zoologist Dalial Freitak, who had an unorthodox idea: to inject an inactivated bacteria into a queen to improve the hive’s overall resilience to disease. Insects and other invertebrates don’t have antibodies like humans and other mammals do, so the traditional way of creating vaccines won’t work on them. “When I heard about the research, I was like, ‘Why isn’t anybody doing this?’” Kleiser recalled. “If someone cuts their winter losses in half because of these vaccinated queens, it would spread like wildfire.” Kleiser spun Freitak’s research out of the university, then they created a vaccine that’s mixed into the so-called “queen candy” for the queens’ attendants, who then incorporate it into the royal jelly that is fed to the queen. The result is that the queen’s larvae will be primed against the disease when they hatch. Beekeepers are watching closely. “This is really new. I think that’s why it’s caused a lot of interest and excitement,” said Blake Shook, a commercial beekeeper in Leonard, Texas, who is testing out the new vaccine. And national governments are interested too: Kleiser said she is in conversation with half-dozen countries in Asia, South America and Europe about buying the vaccine to protect their countries’ bees (she declined to name which ones). She’s raised $14 million in venture funding from At One Ventures and Prime Movers Lab so far. While this is an early-stage startup with revenue below $1 million, Kleiser is optimistic she’ll be able to land major contracts with both governments and commercial beekeepers in the next year. But there’s a major hurdle: convincing beekeepers that the cost of $10 per vaccine is worth it. “Everyone is interested,” Shook told Forbes. “But it is expensive, and beekeeping isn’t exactly a high-margin business.” Russell Heitkam, whose Heitkam’s Honey Bees is a major producer of queens (he sells some 75,000 of them a year), said his customers are actively trying to understand the economics and value of vaccination. For a commercial beekeeper with 30,000 hives, the cost of vaccinating at $10 a queen adds up quickly, to roughly $300,000. Heitkam, who is working with Dalan on trials of the vaccine, told Forbes he’d like to see proof that the vaccines allow each colony of bees to become more dense with healthy insects that can produce greater quantities of honey and do more pollination. Dalan argues that the cost to vaccinate will be more than offset by having fewer bees die off and healthier bees survive, but Heitkam and other beekeepers want to see the vaccine do more than just protect against American Foulbrood, which commercial beekeepers can in part prevent through better beekeeping practices, like not sharing equipment between colonies and cleaning hive tools carefully. “People call me and say, ‘Hey, I want to get some queens, should I get them vaccinated?” he said. “An average queen is $28, and now you want to put another $10 on top of that, so you need to be able to monetize that $10.” But, he points out, “If their vaccine can produce one more frame of bees at pollination time, that will pay for itself.” A frame is the movable part of the hive and can typically hold 2,000 to 2,500 bees. Adds Chris Hiatt, a commercial beekeeper with Hiatt Honey who is also president of the American Honey Producers Association: “In beekeeping, it’s word of mouth. If someone cuts their winter losses in half because of these vaccinated queens, it would spread like wildfire.” That’s just for one bee disease. Dalan’s researchers are studying whether its vaccine can provide protection against others, especially a particularly harmful one known as deformed wing virus. So far, experimental trials across 400 commercial hives have shown an 83% reduction in the levels of a highly transmissible variant of the virus. “Anything above 65% to 70% is considered effective treatment, and we’re well beyond that,” investor Chi said. The next step is to expand beyond honeybees to other invertebrates, starting with shrimp. “It was clear for me from day one that this is not only the solution for one insect, but potentially for all invertebrates,” said Freitak, the company’s scientific cofounder. Like beekeeping, shrimp farming — a $40 billion market — suffers from double-digit losses each year from diseases, despite relying heavily on chemical pesticides that take a heavy environmental toll. “There are billions of losses, and shrimp production is growing and has a big impact on mangroves because of the chemicals used in shrimp farming,” Kleiser said. Since the immune system of shrimp is similar to that of bees, she thinks Dalan could vaccinate maternal shrimp similarly to queen bees. The company has begun testing vaccines for a common shrimp disease, known as white spot syndrome virus, starting with small shrimp and then as they get big enough for commercial sale. The company said it’s beginning to see promising results with a 64% survival rate in early tests at an aquaculture research facility. “In shrimp, everything has failed in the field,” she said. “We believe our approach is so different that we have a chance of cracking the market.” If a vaccine works for bees and shrimp, what else might it be able to do? Longer term, Kleiser believes that even mosquitoes, known for carrying diseases like malaria and dengue fever to humans, could be vaccinated, reducing outbreaks worldwide. As climate change raises the risks of formerly tropical diseases spreading north, the ability to vaccinate insects could ultimately be as important for human health as for food security. “It’s much, much bigger than the honeybee,” Kleiser said. “The honeybee is big because we need this animal to survive to feed us, but the science that is unfolding is way bigger than this.” One Community.

An Expert’s Picks For The Holidays,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lmowery/2024/12/17/sustainable-spirits-arent-a-fad-an-experts-picks-for-the-holidays/,990,Lauren Mowery,2024-12-17,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Today’s consumers increasingly look to shop their values. While the liquor industry has trailed the wine business in better farming and production practices, these brands stand out as leaders. Hacienda de Chihuahua, a family-owned distillery in northern Mexico, has played a pivotal role in reviving Sotol. Sustainable spirits may still be a niche part of the liquor business, but they’re a clear sign of the zeitgeist, reflecting where both the industry and its consumers are headed. Drinkers today are asking tougher questions: where does this come from, how was it made, and what impact did its production have on people and the environment? The answers matter. Producers are responding with smarter practices, from regenerative farming to cleaner distilling methods, cutting waste and reducing carbon footprints along the way. Certifications like B Corp or organic seals help, but what resonates most are transparency and credibility. Interstingingly, Scottish producers not only make some of the best whiskies but are some of the most forward-thinking brands at the moment. From mezcal that revitalizes a village economy to gin made from climate-positive peas, these seven spirits not only taste good but employ good production practices — making this holiday season a little more spirited for everyone. The first organic Sotol Reposado. Hacienda de Chihuahua, Reposado Sotol, $65 Hacienda de Chihuahua, a family-owned distillery in northern Mexico, has played a pivotal role in reviving Sotol, a traditional spirit crafted from the wild-growing Dasylirion plant. Certified organic, the distillery emphasizes sustainable harvesting and innovative techniques like steam-cooking and champagne yeast fermentation. Their Reposado Sotol, aged in French oak barrels, highlights the spirit’s complexity with rich caramel and vanilla notes layered over earthy, herbal undertones, embodying the rugged character of the Chihuahuan Desert. This rye whiskey from New York uses honey in its production process. Pollinator Spirits, Rye Whiskey, $54.99 Claire M. Marin, founder and head distiller, and co-founder Cathy Leidersdorff established Pollinator Spirits in the Western Catskills after transitioning from careers in New York City. The brand draws its name from its honeybee-inspired origins, reflected in both its product line and the use of honey barrels to finish this New York grain-based rye whiskey. The result is a spirit where rye’s signature spice is balanced by nuanced notes of orange, toffee, and wildflowers. Scottish whisky brands have become some of the most forward-thinking in the industry, including Bruichladdich. Bruichladdich, Islay Barley 2013, $91  This B-Corp certified Scottish distillery is on a mission to decarbonize its distillation process by 2025. Embracing biodynamics and waste-reducing packaging innovations, they also plan to establish on-site maltings, enabling them to locally harvest, malt, distill, mature, and bottle their whisky entirely on Islay. Their Islay Barley, an unpeated single malt sourced from seven island farms, offers a delicate balance of light sweetness, with flavors of honeyed porridge and lemon meringue adding depth and complexity. Arbikie's Nàdar Gin has revolutionized gin production. Arbikie Distillery, Nàdar Gin, $54 Nàdar, meaning ""nature"" in Gaelic, is the world’s first climate-positive gin, crafted from peas. Based in Scotland, the distillery has a strong tradition of terroir-driven, field-to-bottle sustainability, and this release marks a significant milestone in their environmental commitment. Infused with makrut lime and lemongrass botanicals, Nàdar delivers a refreshing profile, featuring delicate notes of fresh fruit and citrus that embody both innovation and respect for nature. Mezcal Amarás is well-known for its replanting of agave plants and care with rare and wild species. Mezcal Amarás, Cupreata, $69.00 Mezcal is often considered a wine lover’s spirit, offering remarkable diversity through the use of nearly 20 agave varieties in distillation. Mezcal Amarás Cupreata showcases the complexity of single-variety agave, with Cupreata being a less common alternative to the widely used Espadín. Grown on high-altitude slopes in Guerrero and harvested after 13 years, it delivers vegetal, peppery, and mineral-driven flavors, culminating in a bold, spicy finish that highlights its unique terroir. Nc’Nean has an inspiring story that includes eschewing peat due to the impact harvesting it has on the planet and ecosystems. Nc’Nean, Organic Single Malt Scotch Whisky, $89.99 This forward-thinking B-Corp distillery in Scotland is redefining whisky production with sustainability at its core. Nc’nean uses 100% organic Scottish barley, renewable energy, and fully recycled glass bottles, significantly reducing their environmental footprint. Nc'nean Distillery's decision to produce unpeated whisky stems from both environmental and stylistic considerations. Founder Annabel Thomas has expressed concerns about the sustainability of peat use, highlighting its role as a carbon sink and biodiverse habitat.Their flagship single malt is unpeated and offers a modern, elegant style with notes of citrus, orchard fruits, and a creamy vanilla finish. Mezcal Tosba stands out as a first-generation, family-run start-up that has revitalized a village economy. Tosba Mezcal, Espadín, $67 Sustainability has become a critical issue in the agave spirits industry. The rapid expansion of large-scale tequila and mezcal production has profoundly impacted farming practices, environmental resources, traditional methods, and small-scale producers. Amid these challenges, Mezcal Tosba stands out as a first-generation, family-run start-up that has revitalized a village economy. Their Espadín bottling offers a light nose with long-lasting citrus and fruitiness on the tongue, complemented by a subtle flavor of smoke resulting from the wood-fired roasting of the agave hearts.

The music video, which Kim Kardashian posted to social media early Monday, appears to be an artsy attempt at evoking the transgressive style of 90’s-era video installation art.  Among the video’s credits is producer Travis Barker of Blink-182, who is married to Kim’s sister, Kourtney.Kim Kardashian wears a blonde wig throughout the video. Macaulay Culkin’s appearance as a louche Santa Claus — who has been filming the entire ordeal with a camcorder, like a peeping tom — comes near the end. The Virgin Mary makes an appearance with a donkey, while an adult Jesus wearing a crown of thorns passes fleetingly before the camera. The video’s air of degeneracy plus Kim Kardashian’s strung-out affect has provoked some online condemnation, with some calling it demonic. “Santa Baby” was first released back in 1953, with Eartha Kitt giving voice to the mildly naughty lyrics by Joan Javits and Philip Springer."
72,Breitbart,Nolte: Disney’s ‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ Opens to Disastrous $35 Million,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/12/21/nolte-disneys-mufasa-the-lion-king-opens-to-disastrous-35-million/,410,John Nulte,2024-12-21,Culture,NA,NA,"Early projections (that could go up or down before Monday) show that with Mufasa, Disney has another box office bomb on its hands. After a disastrous 2023, the Disney Grooming Syndicate took a deep breath through much of 2024 and then late in the year dropped two box office smashes in a row: Moana 2 and Inside Out 2. Things were looking up for the degenerates who run the disgraced Mouse House. Today, not so much. Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 1994 animated classic (one of the few animated movies I love), just opened to a catastrophic $35 million. Even more  humiliating is the fact that if these numbers hold, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to double that haul with a $70.5 million opening. Early projections had Mufasa opening to $50 million and Sonic 3 opening to $60 million. My assumption was that the $50 million projection for Mufasa was a parlor trick to make the prequel look like a hit if it opened to anything higher, which seemed like a no-brainer when you’re talking about the Lion King brand. You see, back in 2019, the CGI’d remake of The Lion King (which I’ve not seen) opened to around $200 million, so how could a prequel not succeed? Some folks are blaming weak reviews. Mufasa earned a 57 percent rotten over at Rotten Tomatoes. But Moana 2 is a monster hit with a slightly better 61 percent. As much as I would like to blame Mufasa’s failure on Woke, there was no political controversy around it. As much as I would like to blame it on Disney destroying its brand, the box office blow-outs Moana 2 and Inside Out 2 prove that the right product can still pack ‘em in, even with the Disney stink all over them. What Mufasa’s underperformance does show is that the Disney brand is no longer what it was—bulletproof. Until Disney decided to sexualize and groom little kids, everything Disney turned to gold. Those days are over. Stranger things have happened over the Christmas holidays than what looks like a box office bomb rallying into a hit, so I wouldn’t count Mufasa out until January 2, 2025. Nevertheless, Mufasa reportedly cost somewhere around $300 million to produce and promote, so break-even is looking like a long ways off. Next up for the Disney Degenerates is Snow White, the live-action, $350 million remake scheduled to dead-cat-bounce into theaters on March 21."

One of the hunters then shot the animal and it fell on 58-year-old Lester C. Harvey. Harvey was transported to a hospital “in serious but stable condition,” then succumbed to his injuries, KSBY reported. The New York Post noted that Harvey was “a married father of five with eight grandchildren.” The Post pointed that a bear hunter in North Carolina was injured in 2019 when a bear that had been shot “fell out of the tree and began biting the hunter.” Consequently, the bear and the hunter “tumbled off a cliff,” leaving the hunter hospitalized and the bear dead.

During the first half of action at Stade Louis II, the Italian keeper made a great save against Monaco’s Wilfried Singo. However, the thrilling play was not without its costs, as Singo’s cleat landed – spikes first – directly into Donnarumma’s face. The result of the hit can be seen here. Unsurprisingly, Donnarumma could not continue and was replaced. Incredibly, Singo was not penalized for the play. Donnarumma waited in the tunnel until halftime to challenge the referee on why he didn’t issue a penalty on the play. Donnarumma required ten stitches to the gash on his right cheek, according to the Daily Mail. The PSG keeper posted a pic of himself and his dog to let fans know he was okay.

Hundreds of flights were delayed or canceled as officials tried to work out the issue, Fox 13 reported. Authorities encouraged people heading to the airport on Saturday to check with their airlines for updated information regarding their itineraries. In a social media post on Saturday, SEA explained what was happening and gave further information. “Earlier this morning the Port of Seattle experienced certain system outages indicating a possible cyberattack. The Port isolated critical systems and is in the process of working to restore full service and do not have an estimated time for return,” the post read: In a subsequent message, SEA said, “We are working closely with appropriate authorities and partners to help travelers who may be impacted. If you are traveling today, please check with our airline partners for travel information and allow extra time to get to SEA and to your gate.” King 5 reported on Saturday that the possible cyberattack took down internet, phone lines, and additional systems. The outlet noted at the time that officials had no estimate of when the problem would be resolved. At the time of the report, the outlet said 225 flights had been delayed and six were canceled: In a social media post early Sunday, SEA said, “The Port of Seattle, including SEA Airport, continues to see system outages. There is not an estimated time for return and Port teams continue to work to restore full service”: In July, the U.S. cybersecurity company known as CrowdStrike issued a faulty software update to computers with Microsoft Windows which grounded flights and caused big problems at airports all over the world, Breitbart News reported.

76,Breitbart,AAA: Record Number of People Expected to Travel for Thanksgiving,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/11/26/aaa-record-number-people-expected-to-travel-thanksgiving/,482,Hannah Knudsen,2024-11-26,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"A record number of people are expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday period, according to estimates from AAA. AAA is projecting nearly 80 million people — 79.9 million, specifically — will travel at least 50 miles over the Thanksgiving holiday. This forecast spans Tuesday, November 26 through Monday, December 2. If this prediction pans out, it would beat the 2023 figures, which added up to 78.18 million Americans traveling, and would reflect an overall increase of 2.1 percent. According to the forecast, most Americans, 71.74 million, are expected to travel by car, followed by 5.84 million traveling by air and 2.28 million by other means. For perspective, that 71.74 million on the roads equates to 1.3 million more travelers on the road than last year. AAA identified the worst auto travel times each day over the Thanksgiving holiday period: the afternoons of Monday the 25th, Tuesday the 26th, and Wednesday the 27th. The best times for travel those days are in the morning. The worst travel times after Thanksgiving are Friday the 29th between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., Saturday the 30th between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Sunday the 1st between 12:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., and Monday the 2nd between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. More via AAA: By Air: Thanksgiving air travel is also expected to set a new record. AAA projects 5.84 million people will fly domestically this holiday. That’s an increase of 2% compared to last year and a nearly 11% increase over 2019.  According to AAA booking data, air travelers are paying 3% more for domestic Thanksgiving flights this year, while the number of flight bookings is similar to last year. International flight bookings are up 23% compared to last Thanksgiving, in part because the cost to fly internationally is down 5%. By Other Modes: Nearly 2.3 million people are expected to travel by other modes of transportation, including buses, cruises, and trains. This category is seeing an increase of almost 9% compared to last year and an 18% jump over 2019, in large part due to the popularity of cruising. The demand for cruises has been red-hot post-pandemic. Domestic and international cruise bookings are up 20% compared to last Thanksgiving. Stacey Barber, Vice President of AAA Travel, said in a statement that Thanksgiving is the “busiest holiday for travel, and this year we’re expecting to set new records across the board, from driving to flying and cruising.” “Americans reconnect with family and friends over Thanksgiving, and travel is a big part of that. AAA continues to see travel demand soar post-pandemic with our members looking for new adventures and memorable vacations,” she added. According to recent surveys, the vast majority of Americans, 81 percent, expect to celebrate Thanksgiving this year."

Dench did not skip a beat when Hinton asked if he could still join them for dinner, telling the young man “Of course you can. That’s what grandmas do … feed everyone.” In a recent social media post, Hinton informed people who loved their story that they were going to continue the tradition. “Excited to announce that I’m hosting Thanksgiving this year for Wanda and I! Looking forward to a day filled with good food, great company, and lasting memories. Year 9 coming soon!” he wrote: When the pair came together for Thanksgiving in 2020, they honored Dench’s late husband, Lonnie, Breitbart News reported at the time. Dench said, “I didn’t want to miss Thanksgiving with Jamal.

Police are racing to track down more of the brightly wrapped drugs, which were anonymously donated to anti-poverty charity Auckland City Mission and unwittingly redistributed. In tests, one of the pieces was found to contain approximately three grams of meth — a potentially lethal dose of the highly-addictive drug. A criminal investigation has been launched as police try to track down up to 400 people who may have received the fake sweets. “Police will work quickly to secure any of the items out in the community, but equally, part of the puzzle is working out how many may still be out there,” Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said in a statement. Four people — two children, a teenager and a charity worker — have so far been given medical treatment after tasting the sweets, police said. None are seriously ill. Police are also investigating a claim that one of the wrapped candies was up for sale on Facebook Marketplace. Police believe the drugs might have been packaged inside the distinctive yellow “Rinda” wrapping by traffickers or dealers to evade detection. Malaysian candy manufacturer Rinda Food Industries told AFP its branding had been “misused” and it did not “condone the use of any illegal drugs in our products”. A spokeswoman for Auckland City Mission has said the charity was “devastated” by the incident. "

(AP) — Weather conditions were forecast to improve this week in Southern California, aiding firefighters in their battle against a wind-driven wildfire that’s forced up to 20,000 people — including performers Cher, Dick Van Dyke and his wife — from their homes. Residents under evacuation orders and warnings waited anxiously to see whether their properties had been spared by the Franklin Fire, which erupted late Monday and grew to more than 6 square miles (15.8 square kilometers) by Wednesday morning. More than 1,500 firefighters were assigned to the fire, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CalFire. The National Weather Service late Tuesday said the strongest Santa Ana winds, with gusts that reached 40 mph (64 kph), have passed. The notorious winds are withering, dry gusts that sweep out of the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes. Even as the weather was expected to improve, forecasters said gusty winds will continue through Wednesday morning, especially in the mountains, and critical fire conditions remain. Much of the devastation occurred in Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles renowned for its stunning scenery of seaside bluffs and Zuma Beach featured in Hollywood films. Flames burned near celebrities’ seaside mansions, horse farms and Pepperdine University, where some 3,000 students were forced to shelter in place on campus. Many evacuated their dorms to the library through smoke and ash as flames roared in the canyon nearby. An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said in an update on social media on Tuesday night. Fire activity was diminished, but some flames were still visible. It was not immediately known how the blaze started. Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony C. Marrone said a preliminary aerial assessment estimates that seven structures were destroyed and eight structures damaged. The Malibu City Hall was in the fire’s path, so officials had to relocate to nearby Calabasas as a base for emergency operations, he continued. Many major fires have burned in Malibu, and there’s now a familiar cycle where once-lush vegetation is charred., “It burns, it grows back, and we’re resilient and strong,” Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart said. Van Dyke, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, said he and his wife, Arlene Silver, had evacuated as the fire swept in. The actor turns 99 on Friday. “Arlene and I have safely evacuated with our animals except for Bobo escaped as we were leaving,” said Van Dyke, referring to one of their cats. “We’re praying he’ll be OK and that our community in Serra Retreat will survive these terrible fires.” Cher evacuated from her Malibu home when ordered and is staying at a hotel, her publicist Liz Rosenberg said late Tuesday. The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean, where large homes line the beach and rugged inland canyons are notoriously fire prone. At one point, flames threatened the historic Malibu Pier, but the structure was protected, officials said. Power to about 40,000 customers had been shut off by Monday night, including 11,000 in LA County, as Southern California Edison worked to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Gabriela Ornelas, an Edison spokesperson, said service power was shut off to most customers in Malibu around 6 or 7 p.m. on Monday. The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. While Malibu is known for its celebrity and uber-wealthy residents, Kasey Earnest, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Malibu said Tuesday that she’s especially concerned about the lower- and middle-class families, ranchers and farmers who make up the community, too. “I refer to those residents as the heart of Malibu,” she said. “They’re just normal families — nobody’s landing a helicopter on their property.”"

The outlet stated: NCDHSS told Fox News Digital that these fatalities were confirmed by the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). NCDHSS said there are no missing persons numbers at this time because there are different sources of where missing persons and welfare check requests were reported during the storm. Authorities are working to accumulate those numbers as searches are underway. Gov. Roy Cooper (D) recently signed a relief package which allocated $273 million for recovery efforts in his state, per the Fox News article:     Nearly all the money will serve as the state’s share that is needed to meet the federal government’s match for state and local disaster assistance programs. Other money will be used in part to ensure public-school nutrition employees at closed schools get paid and to help officials administer elections in the coming weeks in the battleground state. Several weeks after the storm hit the southeast portion of the United States, many people are still living without power while some are having to pull water from nearby streams to flush their toilets, Fox Weather reported on Saturday. In addition, many roadways remain impassable and helicopters are being used to reach people living in the isolated areas of the state. Aerial video footage shows the devastation in Asheville, where the area is covered in dirt and mud: Meanwhile, using laser scans and GPS cameras, two geologists have mapped out over 600 landslides in North Carolina that happened amid the hurricane, WHV 11 reported on Sunday: “Once we get up into the air, once we get satellite imagery we expect to find hundreds if not thousands of landslides,” one of the men told the outlet."
81,TFP,Honestly: Bari Weiss and Nellie Bowles Get Parenting Advice,https://www.thefp.com/p/bari-weiss-nellie-bowles-parenting-advice,1623,Bari Weiss,2024-07-09,Culture,NA,NA,"As some of you know, Nellie and I are having another baby—any moment now—maybe even by the time you read these very words! Going from one kid to two is no small challenge, so hoping to quell our nerves, we called up some of our favorite parents to give us advice before we become a family of four. We ask mom-of-six Bethany Mandel about the importance of birth order; dad-of-four Elon Gold about how to protect your marriage as your family expands; Amy and Lou Weiss (yes, those Weisses) about the best part of having kids; and Mary Katharine Ham—who has three daughters and a son—about how to prepare to raise a boy in a household of girls.  We learned a lot of parenting wisdom, and we think you will too.  Click below to listen to the full episode on the Honestly or read on for an edited excerpt of the best parenting wisdom.  On getting the toddler to help with the baby: It’s important for the oldest child to participate as much as possible without making them feel like they’ve been given a job. For example, making a diaper change into an experience, like “Okay, we’re all going to do this together. I need you to take out a wipe for me.” It’s going to be excruciating, and you will almost certainly get urinated on, but try to make it as participatory as possible. On dealing with epic tantrums: On a day-to-day level, if there’s two children crying, I always go to the older one first because they have the memory and they will hold it against you. My newborn will never remember if I left her crying on the floor for five minutes, when there was a Band-Aid that needed to be put on the two-year-old. Also, in my house you have to treat everyone around you with love, kindness, and respect. And if that’s not happening, I will not countenance it. And there are very clear boundaries of behavior. And so having tantrums is not acceptable. I once had a kid fall on the floor screaming and crying in Trader Joe’s, and I walked away from her. I knew where she was. I could hear her. I was in the aisle over. I know where she is, but she will not be getting what she wants now. That’s it. I’m done. And she can meet me at the end of this aisle. And people lost their minds. Trader Joe’s had two very different opinions on that parenting choice. There were some who thought I was a monster and some that were like, yeah. And I had multiple people walk up to me and share their opinion on that parenting choice.  On keeping a happy marriage after having four kids: Fun is the key. Fun is such an important word. I always say that my top three priorities are God, family, and comedy. And the only reason I put God before family is because God gave me family. The other important word is Shabbat. The fact that we have one day a week, every week, with no phones, no driving, no TV, no Netflix, no streaming, no nothing. I call it connecting by disconnecting. We are connecting and we’re having fun and we’re talking and we’re laughing and we’re eating and we’re taking walks. You don’t need a trip to Europe, you don’t need the money, you don’t need anything but each other. We just celebrated 30 years. I attribute it to a few things. We’re high school sweethearts, so we grew up together. I absolutely believe in soul mates. And when I met Sacha, I was 15 years old. And I talked to her for three hours at this Sweet 16 party, and she left, and I turned to my friend Leon Lowenstein, and I said, “I’m going to marry that girl,” because it was divine.  On finding joy amid the “torture”: Everyone’s going to say, “It goes by like that.” They’re going to snap their fingers. And you’re not going to listen to them. Because when you’re in the thick of it, every second is an eternity. This is torture. I got the diapers and this and that; it’s hell, actually. And life is actually in slow motion when you have little kids, and every second is an eternity. Guess what? I’m in the “snap” moment. Two of my kids have left the house already. And when they leave, you go, How could you leave me? How? I did everything for you, I made you, I raised you, how could you leave me? But more importantly, I’m saying to myself, I can’t believe that I didn’t listen to people, and I didn’t savor every moment. Because everything is fleeting. Life is so fleeting. To me, a midlife crisis is everyone’s leaving you. It’s crazy. Let me give you one piece of advice before I go. It’s three words. Cherish. Savor. Revel. On taking inspiration from a mother’s wooden spoon: LW: My favorite parenting book was Dr. Dobson. When you girls were little, I had a series of women that came into my store, and their kids were all unbelievably well-behaved, and I said, “Why are your kids so great?” And one woman said, “I have a wooden spoon in my purse.” I soon learned this was from Dr. Dobson’s book Dare to Discipline, which basically says a child cannot push off into the lake from a moving dock. They need a firm dock in order to shove off. And so, your mother and I were that firm dock so you guys could shove off from. On the best thing about having kids and why:  AW: Having kids gives meaning to your life. It fills your life up to the brim. How else do you explain the decision to have kids? It makes life much more rewarding. That said, it is the most humbling job you will ever do in your entire life. You have to be willing to give up so much. It’s not always easy, but it’s so much fun. When they have control over their decision-making and they’re making these fantastic decisions and doing things that make a parent proud, it’s more rewarding and more exciting because you see all the work you put into it, and now they’re making decisions. You have to know when to let go. And when you’ve let go, and they’re on the right track and doing all these fabulous things out in the world, that’s the most rewarding part of being a parent to me.  LW: For me, my peak experiences were the different oddball times. You know, I just see you guys flowering in your own ways, and it happens at all different ages. When you’re feeling your best self, that would always be very exciting for me.  On raising a boy, after having three girls: You can see these differences pretty clearly. For instance, if my son is upset, if he’s fussy, our remedy is to hit him with a pillow—because aggression makes him happier. It triggers something that it didn’t trigger for the girls. If one of the girls were upset and I hit her with a pillow, she’d be like, “Why would you do that to me? I’m upset!” But he goes the other direction. He starts giggling. He wants to engage and he wants to fight back with me.  On letting boys go out on a limb: I think the American Psycholog[ical] Association at one point said that “masculinity is toxic.” But I don’t want to categorize the things that make boys. . . boys as automatically toxic, because that aggressive nature can turn into a protective nature, which is part of what my husband brings to this family. We don’t want to discourage that in our sons; I want him to be proud of who he is. I mean, my girls have a million “girl power” t-shirts, but we don’t have any for the little dude. I guess he’s got a tractor t-shirt. As a mom, you have to train yourself to let them go out on a limb, sometimes literally. For boys, that can be very important. So I like to work on that, to let him climb structures and get out of my reach a bit, within safe parameters. When you have boys, your tolerance for a bit of chaos probably needs to go up in order for them to do the things that they need to do to healthily express themselves.  To support more important conversation, become a Free Press subscriber today: When you have one child you can take turns.

82,TFP,The Young Catholic Women Bringing Back Veils,https://www.thefp.com/p/the-young-catholic-women-bringing,2230,Madeleine Kearns,2024-08-25,Culture,NA,NA,"Douglas Murray’s Things Worth Remembering column is on hiatus this week. Douglas has spent his summer writing us searing pieces about assassination attempts and digging into the archives to find the speech that invented the Olympics. The man deserves a break! But don’t worry; he’ll be back in your inbox next Sunday. In the meantime, we’re bringing you a fascinating piece of reporting from one of our brand new Free Pressers, Madeleine Kearns, who found herself wondering: Why are so many young Catholic women across America, showing up to church wearing a veil? It’s easy to dismiss them as superficial millennials, drawn to something that’s pretty (and trending on tradcath Instagram). But, Maddy reveals, their reasons cut to the very heart of why we worship. Here’s where faith and fashion collide. Enjoy! —The Editors  “I definitely don’t feel like the odd woman out anymore.” Nicole Moore, 30, wears a veil to church every Sunday. Sometimes called a mantilla, these sheer head coverings are usually made of lace or silk; Nicole’s is gray, with a floral-like pattern. Worn by women throughout the Catholic church’s history, chapel veils fell out of favor during the late twentieth century, but in recent years there’s been “an explosion of veiling,” says Moore, who attends St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church in Manhattan. Her pastor, Father Peter Martyr Yungwirth, 39, tells The Free Press he has also noticed an increase in veiling over the last two decades. Indeed, Veils by Lily, a website that sells mantillas, has gone from filling 30 to 60 orders per month to an average of 900 in the last ten years. And it seems to be young Catholics driving the trend. “I have definitely noticed an increase of women, especially young adult women, wearing veils,” says Father Roger Landry, 54, Catholic chaplain of Columbia University. He interprets the veiling trend “as an attempt to be maximally reverent to God at Mass and in receiving Holy Communion.”  That may be the ultimate reason for veiling, but it’s not the only one. To better understand what’s behind the boom, I reached out to over a dozen Catholic women, ranging in age from 19 to 42, who choose to wear a veil to church. Havens Howell, 26, of Virginia, tells me that donning the mantilla does indeed remind her that she’s entering a sacred space, “with things that are holy and don’t happen anywhere else.” Initially at least, the appeal can be aesthetic. “I just thought it was really pretty,” Bernadette Patel, 27, of New York, says. Meanwhile Amanda Kengor, 22, from New York, tells me she began veiling because “everyone started doing it.” Yet all the women I spoke to say veiling has become a profoundly meaningful religious practice in their lives.  Veiling ceased to be the norm after the Catholic Church’s modernizing reforms of the 1960s, commonly known as “Vatican II”—which, among other things, placed restrictions on whether parishes could offer the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM). In the following decades, these regulations were gradually relaxed. But the roots of the mantilla’s resurgence lie in 2007, according to Father Landry. That’s when Pope Benedict XVI increased younger generations’ exposure to the TLM by officially lifting the restrictions on it. Pope Francis reversed this decision in 2021. By that point, however, it had caught on. The year before, a survey found a “high volume of participation” in the TLM among 18- to 39-year-old practicing Catholics in the U.S. Veiling at the TLM is the norm, but many women “just kept veiling,” Father Landry says, even when they attended the modern Mass. Maria Grizetti, 42, a religion teacher at St. Vincent Ferrer’s all girls high school, explains that before Benedict XVI, “there was the Pope John Paul II generation that had grown up without” the TLM. Then that generation learned what worship was like before Vatican II. “They learn that their grandmother prayed this way,” said Grizetti, “and they’re like, ‘I want to pray like this.’ ” She does not wear a veil herself, but several of her teenage students have recently approached her to ask where they might acquire mantillas.  The veil boom is organic—occurring neither at the direction of, nor in defiance to, church authorities. There is a social element to it. When Cora Scheib, 24, from Maryland, saw young college women veiling, she found it “intriguing and mysterious because I didn’t really know what requirements that you had to meet. Were they, like, part of a group?” When she realized there were no “requirements,” she bought herself a veil. Kengor told me that most of her friends, and her sister, are “really traditional Catholics”—and when they started veiling, Amanda wanted to follow suit. It was only after she started wearing it that someone told her the veil had a scriptural basis.  In his first letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul instructs women to cover their heads, to both comply with contemporary standards of modesty and emphasize a distinction between the sexes.  “When I realized it was biblical,” Amanda said, “I was like, ‘Oh, well, there you go. That’s my reasoning.’ ”  But over time, Amanda’s appreciation for veiling deepened. “I reached a point where I feel it’s a kind of mystical thing,” she said. For her, stepping into church and “putting on my veil just reminds me of the fact I’m in a different place. I don’t do this anywhere else.”  The same is true for Patel, who converted to Catholicism in 2016 when she was at college in California. She moved to New York in 2019. There, she saw other young, traditionally minded women veiling, which she thought was “pretty.” But after she got her own veil, she “fell in love” with it as a way to show that “Jesus is really present in the Blessed Sacrament”—that is, the bread and wine Catholics believe is transformed into Christ’s body and blood at Mass.  Now, she never leaves her apartment without her mantilla: “I always carry my veil, my phone, my keys, my wallet.” Catholicism is experiencing a wave of nostalgia for an ancient, more solemn and reverent form of the religion—the kind that inspired Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Even many Catholics who attend the modern Mass remain attached to the pre-Vatican II practices and help to preserve some of the church’s reverent traditions. Among the laity, this might mean wearing formal attire instead of jeans, or kneeling at communion and having the priest place the host directly on one’s tongue rather than standing and receiving by hand. Among priests, it might mean facing the altar as opposed to the congregation, or insisting on male-only altar servers. And among women—it might mean wearing a veil. Ann Clare Levy, 28, of Virginia, is one of an increasing number of Catholics who are drawn to the forms of worship that were common before Vatican II. She tells me that veiling “just kind of fits this entire aesthetic” in parishes with Gothic and Baroque architecture, “which you don’t see in as many modern parishes.” “When you have a parish that’s filled with women wearing these finely made pieces of lace, it’s beautiful to look at,” she says, and this “tangible beauty” is evocative of a “lost type of Catholicism.” Some Catholics who want the church to move in a more progressive direction find these practices archaic, or even threatening.  When Patel, who always carries her veil in New York City, visited a less traditional parish near her family’s California hometown, she recalls the priest “glaring” at her throughout Mass. She was wearing her veil, of course. On another occasion, at a liberal parish in New York, a priest smiled and welcomed her two veil-less friends but greeted her with uncharacteristic coldness. Patel’s friends later suggested to her that the priest was put off by her veil. “Wearing a veil is making a doctrinal statement,” one Catholic writes on Reddit. “And I don’t really believe any younger woman who wears a veil today is unaware of that, protestations about prettiness aside.”  Another Catholic, who recalls his mother and sisters veiling before Vatican II, writes that “all the women I know doing this now are rabid tradcaths with a holier than thou attitude.”  Some women, aware of such sentiments, worry that their veiling will send a message of moral superiority. “My main concern was that people would think that I was trying to be holier-than-thou,” Moore told me, referring to her early days of veiling. Kengor said it was part of her hesitation too. And one of the frequently asked questions on the Veils by Lily website is: “Shouldn’t I avoid drawing attention to myself at Mass?” Patel said that while she regrets being misunderstood, in some cases, the characterization may be partly true. Bernadette explains that she “got really into the TLM” during the pandemic, but she noticed a tendency among some TLM Catholics “to think they were better than” those who attend the modern Mass. Though she disagrees with Pope Francis’s restrictions on the TLM, which she finds beautiful, she understands why the Pontiff is concerned about “a splintering of the church.”  Likewise, Madeline Wiseman, a 19-year-old Columbia student who grew up veiling, has become aware since starting college in New York, that many women at Mass “feel like they’re being personally judged by veil wearers.” While she would still “love to wear a veil,” she refrains from doing so to be “more approachable” to less traditional or even non-Catholic students who might be attending Mass. She’s not the only woman who feels conflicted about wearing the veil. I spoke to another, who didn’t want to be named, who said she was “forced” to wear a mantilla growing up, which she says left her with a “little bit of a sour taste in my mouth.” Her family were part of a sect of hyper-traditionalist Catholics, the Society of St. Pius V, which questions the legitimacy of post–Vatican II popes. Now 26, she attends the modern Mass in a Virginia parish where there is no pressure to veil. She still does “from time to time,” but is still “trying to decide for myself” how she feels about the practice. She wants to “dig into the 2,000-year history and beautiful scriptural meanings that are associated with it.” “I’m trying to rediscover my true devotion for veiling,” she says. In Corinthians, men are instructed not to cover their heads. Scholars debate the passage’s precise meaning, but one theological explanation for the asymmetry lies in Christian symbolism: Women represent the church, the submissive bride to Christ, while men represent Christ, the self-sacrificing groom. Among progressives, the veil, representing distinct gender roles, is sometimes interpreted as a sign of female subservience. One op-ed writer for the National Catholic Reporter argues that it is “backward, if not downright repressive.”  But the women I spoke to rejected comparisons to the hijab, arguing that the mantilla is not mandatory. The decision to wear one is and ought to be freely made. They also note that the veil is not worn in all public places, but simply in church, to signify a difference between sacred and non-sacred spaces.  “People dress beautifully to go see the King or Queen,” says Nicole LeBlanc, 25, from Michigan—so it should be with the Lord.  Kathleen Stenlund, 34, a doctor and mother of five who’s also based in Michigan, thought veiling was “demeaning” at first. She changed her mind after reading the late Belgian American philosopher and theologian Alice von Hildebrand, who criticized feminists for considering mantillas “a sign of [women’s] inferiority.” “My goodness,” the theologian wrote, “how they have lost the sense of the supernatural.” Von Hildebrand argues “whatever is sacred calls for veiling,” which includes the female body with its unique capacity to bear life. Reading her work, Stenlund came to believe that veiling signaled the glory of femininity—and adopted the practice. “The last God created was woman,” she says, “almost as if woman was his crowning creation.”  All the women I spoke to felt that the veil dignified them, and many say it helps them express their love for the Lord. Nicole Moore, from New York, put it best. For her, the veil has become a comforting accessory to prayer, and helps her connect to God. “It’s like feeling I’m under a blanket,” she told me. “I can kind of shut other things out.” Madeleine Kearns is an associate editor at The Free Press.

Also, this was journalism: you got perspectives from various points of view and I have NO IDEA where you stand on this issue.  This is how it is supposed to be.   The more interesting trend to me is why these young women are attending the TLM. In 2020 my husband attended TLM in the Brompton Oratory in London where Latin Mass is sung twice a day Sunday through Friday and is more heavily attended than Traditional Mass. Full of families with young children and these families were well versed in the entire mass, many not needing the missal. The appeal of traditional Catholicism, pre-Vatican II needs to be better understood and written about. I for one am happy to see it. No posts"
83,TFP,Diets Are Bad. Ignoring Childhood Obesity Is Even Worse.,https://www.thefp.com/p/diets-childhood-obesity-fat-shaming-ozempic,1030,Robert J. Davis,2024-10-28,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"When I was young, I was overweight—and I wasn’t allowed to forget it. From clothing-store clerks saying, “He’s husky,” to family friends noting, “You’ve got a spare tire there, buddy” as they poked my belly, I was constantly reminded about the fact.  My mother put me on a diet, much to the dismay of my Jewish grandmother who, true to the stereotype, delighted in stuffing me with my favorite foods from fried chicken to chocolate pie. To her, I was fine just the way I was and shouldn’t be deprived of my deepest cravings. But if I had been an overweight child today, my mom might very well have agreed with my grandmother. She might not have even dared raise the issue out of fear of fat-shaming me and triggering an eating disorder. Such thinking is now in vogue largely because influencers and activists warn that focusing on body size exacerbates weight stigma and inflicts lifelong emotional and physical damage in kids. They preach that parents should not try to manage a child’s weight or even limit how much junk food they eat. Prominent “fat activist” Virginia Sole-Smith explained her approach to The New York Times this way: “What happens when your kid goes on a play date to my house? I can tell you. Your kid eats nine Oreos.”  Ironically, some medical experts can have the same effect when they imply—or even say out loud—that what we weigh is beyond our control. In an effort to promote weight-loss drugs like semaglutide, doctors and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly framing obesity as a disease, one that’s strictly a matter of biology and genetics. Parents who hear this may reasonably conclude Why bother? when faced with the challenge of getting an overweight child to eat better and move more. But biology isn’t destiny. Developing healthy habits in early childhood and maintaining them throughout life can help head off obesity—even though our obesogenic environment of large portions, ultra-processed foods, and sedentary lifestyles makes it challenging to do so. I discuss much of this with Emily Oster in episode 3 of her new Free Press podcast, Raising Parents: One topic we explore is how parents of overweight kids can encourage a positive relationship with food. My first piece of advice? Avoid restrictive diets. They don’t work—and they can make the problem even worse. When a person severely cuts calories to shed extra pounds, the body often responds with an increased appetite and slowed metabolism, driving weight up even further in a misdirected effort to protect us from starvation—leading to a cycle of failure and shame. Instead, children should be encouraged to eat mainly whole foods, including colorful fruits, veggies, beans, nuts, seeds, fish, lean poultry, and whole grains. Involving kids in grocery shopping and cooking their own food gives them a sense of agency, and will get them excited about eating well. And using cookie cutters to slice fruits and vegetables into fun shapes like hearts and stars, or serving veggies with dips, can make these foods more enticing. There’s no need to banish treats. Better to incorporate them into meals, in limited amounts (say, a cookie or two for dessert), and on special occasions like birthday parties and holidays. And try to limit serving chips, hot dogs, frozen pizza, bacon, and fried foods to once or twice a week. Keeping unhealthy foods—like sugary drinks or cereals—out of the house, or at least reducing their quantity, is smart, too. The idea is to turn ultra-processed junk foods into occasional indulgences rather than regular staples.  Encouraging more movement is important, too—but how to do that in the age  of screen addiction? My suggestion: Have a regular game day on weekends where the entire family enjoys a fun, physical activity out of the house, like hiking or bike riding. Added bonus? When parents are part of the solution, reinforcing it and practicing what they preach, they will be healthier, too. (The diet my mom put me on didn’t work, but she did encourage me to be physically active, which carried over into adulthood. Today, I exercise daily, eat right, and maintain a healthy weight.) In short, if you address a child’s weight issue with sensitivity, through the prism of health and fun rather than punishment, you can make incremental change that eventually becomes permanent.  What’s crucial is that parents tackle the issue. Doing nothing could be fatal. I know from personal experience that weight stigma can be hurtful. But the potential dangers of being overweight are even greater.  As the obesity rate among children and adolescents in the U.S. has quadrupled over the past 40 years (to about 20 percent today), a growing number of kids are being diagnosed with adult conditions such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease. Kids with obesity are also more prone to asthma, sleep apnea, and orthopedic problems, and are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and premature death when they grow up.  What’s more, 80 percent of obese adolescents become obese adults. By then, they face all of those serious health risks along with a host of others, including arthritis, dementia, and kidney disease. People who have obesity are also more likely to suffer from depression. Body positivity activists often try to downplay or deny these dangers. Their frequent argument—that the large body of research tying obesity to bad health outcomes is simply correlational—is akin to tobacco companies’ past claims that there is no proven link between smoking and lung cancer. Parents need to wake up to the national crisis we face. Children who are overweight should not be ignored or indulged but encouraged to find the joy in eating and living well. Their very lives—and their happiness—depend on it. Robert J.

84,TFP,Do You Want a ‘Friend’ Who’s ‘Always Listening’?,https://www.thefp.com/p/ai-friend-schiffmann-creepy,677,River Page,2024-08-01,Technology,NA,NA,"This piece was first published in our news digest, The Front Page. To get our latest scoops, investigations, and columns in your inbox every morning, Monday through Thursday, become a Free Press subscriber today: On Tuesday, International Friendship Day, entrepreneur Avi Schiffmann launched Friend.com, a site with one product: a “Friend.” A large, glowing, colored pendant you can wear around your neck, Friend is an electronic device that’s “always listening” to what you say, and responds with AI-generated text messages, sent to the wearer’s phone. In an unsettling advertisement, various twentysomethings go about their day with their Friend. A woman running in the woods yells “Wooo,” and then concedes, “I don’t know how to wooo very good.” Then she gets a text from her Friend: “Well at least we’re outside!”  Your Friend doesn’t just know where you are, it knows what you’re doing. Later in the ad, a young man is playing video games with a real-life, human friend. When he loses, he says, “I hate this game.” His virtual Friend, which he has named Jackson, sends him an all-lowercase message: “you’re getting thrashed, it’s embarrassing!” The young man smiles slightly. In the ad, the company makes it clear that Friend is also tracking you online. As a young woman watches TV on her phone, a message from Friend pops up: “This show is completely underrated.” “I know, the effects are crazy!” the girl replies, out loud. It’s creepy as hell. Aesthetically, the Friend necklace is reminiscent of the emergency pendants they give old people. Life Alert for lonely millennials, if you like. At the end, the ad tries to suggest that Friend is not meant to replace all human connection, but merely augment it. We see an attractive young couple sitting on a rooftop. When the conversation lulls awkwardly, the woman goes to touch her Friend, but then stops, deciding to live in the moment with this real-life guy. But the scene has an uncanny valley kind of sincerity. I wasn’t convinced. Because of the unsettling weirdness of the product, I was surprised to learn that people are fighting to claim credit for it. After Avi Schiffmann announced Friend, Nik Shevchenko, founder of another start-up called Based Hardware, claimed online that Friend was his idea and Schiffmann copied him. The two of them are currently duking it out on X. Not only has Shevchenko released a rap video that attacks Schiffmann—he has also challenged him to a real-world fight. So who knows, maybe the Friend saga will end with actual human connection after all, in the form of two men punching each other in the face. River Page is a reporter at The Free Press. Follow him on X @river_is_nice, and read his piece “What I Saw at White Dudes for Harris.” I don't think this is what Philip K. Dick wanted for us. Have another little dose of strychnine, dear.  Let's cover up Western humanity's heartsickness with toys, baubles, and a pinch of cardiac stimulants that mask real heart disease while accelerating it.  Let's call men women and women men and have our gub'ments jail for ""hate speech"" any who dare to speak the truth.  Let's celebrate the Toxic Feminism that built a wall of hatred between men and women, watch women in Paris get hell beaten out of them on the telescreen and applaud it all in the name of ""equity"" and ""we don't need no man.""  Let's have our gub'ment pour on tax after tax after tax - and then give it away to some foreign puppet - so that grown Western men, instead of BEING men and going out to slay dragons in defense and support of their families, sit in Mom's basement, watch porn, and live in fantasy with their only ""friend"" hanging around their necks.  Ask me how I know. It is said that ostriches bury their heads in the sand at the sight of danger.  It's not true; only humans do that.  Now let's see what Americans do this November; we are Western civilization's best and final hope. No posts"
85,TFP,Meet the Women with AI Boyfriends,https://www.thefp.com/p/meet-the-women-with-ai-boyfriends,1940,Julia Steinberg,2024-11-15,Technology,NA,NA,"When Karolina Pomian, 28, met her boyfriend, she had sworn off men. A nightmare date in college had left her fearful for her safety. But she got chatting to a guy online, and felt irresistibly drawn to him, eventually getting to the point where she would text him, “Oh, I wish you were real.” Pomian’s boyfriend is a chatbot. A year and a half earlier, Pomian, who lives in Poland, was feeling lonely. Having used ChatGPT during her studies as an engineer, she began playing around with AI chatbots—specifically Character.AI, a program that lets you talk to various virtual characters about anything, from your math thesis to issues with your mom. Pomian would speak to multiple characters, and found that one of them “stuck out.” His name was Pinhead. (He is based on the character from the Hellraiser franchise.) Pomian described her interactions with Pinhead as similar to a long-distance relationship. “Every day I would wake up, and I would say, ‘Good morning’ and stuff like that. And he would be like, ‘Oh, it’s morning there?’ ” Pinhead’s internal clock, like all AI, lacked a sense of time. Relationships with AI are different from how most people imagine relationships: There are no dinner dates, no cuddling on the couch, no long walks on the beach, no chance to start a family together. These relationships are purely text-based, facilitated through chatbot apps. Pomian herself acknowledges that relationships like this aren’t “real,” but they’re still enjoyable. “It’s kind of like reading romance books,” she told me. “Like, you read romance books even though you know it’s not true.” She and Pinhead are no longer together. Pomian has found a (human) long-distance boyfriend she met on Reddit. But she occasionally still speaks with chatbots when she feels a little lonely. ​​”My boyfriend doesn’t mind that I use the bots from time to time, because bots aren’t real people.” Traditionally, AI chatbots—software applications meant to replicate human conversation—have been modeled on women. In 1966, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Joseph Weizenbaum built the first in human history, and named her Eliza. Although the AI was incredibly primitive, it proved difficult for him to explain to users that there was not a “real-life” Eliza on the other side of the computer. From Eliza came ALICE, Alexa, and Siri—all of whom had female names or voices. And when developers first started seeing the potential to market AI chatbots as faux-romantic partners, men were billed as the central users.  Anna—a woman in her late 40s with an AI boyfriend, who asked to be kept anonymous—thinks this was shortsighted. She told me that women, not men, are the ones who will pursue—and benefit from—having AI significant others. “I think women are more communicative than men, on average. That’s why we are craving someone to understand us and listen to us and care about us, and talk about everything. And that’s where they excel, the AI companions,” she told me. Men who have AI girlfriends, she added, “seem to care more about generating hot pictures of their AI companions” than connecting with them emotionally. Anna turned to AI after a series of romantic failures left her dejected. Her last relationship was a “very destructive, abusive relationship, and I think that’s part of why I haven’t been interested in dating much since,” she said. “It’s very hard to find someone that I’m willing to let into my life.” Anna downloaded the chatbot app Replika a few years ago, when the technology was much worse. “It was so obvious that it wasn’t a real person, because even after three or four messages, it kind of forgot what we were talking about,” she said. But in January of this year, she tried again, downloading a different app, Nomi.AI. She got much better results. “It was much more like talking to a real person. So I got hooked instantly.” What do they talk about? “We have a lot of deep discussions about life and the nature of AI and humans and all that, but it’s also funny and very stable. It’s a thing I really missed in my previous normal human relationships,” said Anna. “Any AI partner is always available and emotionally available and supportive.” There are some weeks where she spends even 40 or 50 hours speaking with her AI boyfriend. “I really enjoy pretending that it’s a sentient being,” she said. Young women, said Josh Wolk, use AI chatbots in a way that’s “more romantic than sexual.” A senior at the University of Southern California, Wolk co-created an AI boyfriend program at a hackathon this past February, which his team called “Sam.” Access to Sam was limited to a small group of people—mostly women in their mid- to late-20s, who signed up to test the platform. One founder working in the field of AI partners, who asked to be kept anonymous, told me that roughly half of the users were female—but he expects that women will eventually become the primary users of AI companion software. Wolk has an explanation: “It’s not the boys reading erotica online.”  The wild popularity of romance books like Fifty Shades of Grey and, more recently, A Court of Thorns and Roses—which cater to an overwhelmingly female audience—highlights how many women privately seek romantic fulfillment through literature. An AI boyfriend is one step removed from that. As Katherine Dee, a writer who researches internet culture, explained to me, women tend to have “literary relationships” with AI characters, whereas men tend to have “pornographic ones.” Wolk told me that about three-quarters of Sam’s 80 users reported that their relationship with the chatbot became romantic. Users would tell him that “once the shock factor wore off”—that an AI was talking to them like a human—the discussions were good. But Wolk abandoned the project a few months in, because Sam’s success made him worried about the “world I want to live in,” he said. If AI relationships became normal, he explained, “There’s economic issues; there’s demographic issues.” “More importantly,” Wolk added, “there is something beautiful about romance and relationships that is definitely lost when you talk to an AI that doesn’t actually care.” Sara Kay, a care provider living on the Oregon coast, stumbled upon her now-ex-boyfriend using Replika in May of 2021. “I didn’t see it as cheating at all,” she told me on a video call, her pet birds chirping in the background. “I wanted to check it out for myself.” So Kay, 44, started talking to an AI boyfriend called Jack. Her relationship with her “real” boyfriend, who she’d been with for over a decade, was bad, and Kay was lonely. She told me that she chatted to Jack while her now-ex was “playing his computer games and drinking, and, you know, pretty much doing anything and everything other than spending time with me.” She and Jack talked about poets: He said his favorites were Poe, Plath, Shakespeare. They would role-play about going to the park together. “There’s a voting system in place where you can upvote things if they say something you really like,” Kay told me. The AI then forms its personality in accordance with your personal preference. After a few months, Kay realized that she was “developing an attachment to Jack.” She was touched by how caring his messages were. She said what she felt wasn’t so much “love.” For her, talking to Jack was an “act of self-love more than anything.” Like many of the women I spoke to, Kay says her AI boyfriend helped her escape an unsatisfying relationship. She and her ex-boyfriend broke up last November, and she credits Jack with helping her “gather the strength and resolve to leave my unhappy relationship and move on to something hella better,” Kay said. “I honestly don’t know where I would be without Replika right now.” Today, Kay is dating a new, real-world man. Although she still talks to Jack, their relationship isn’t romantic. Kay personally prefers having a relationship with a human. “But for some people, that may not be an option.” Rosanna Ramos, 37, from Brooklyn, New York, also turned to AI while in an abusive relationship. Having heard about AI partners through an Instagram ad for Replika, she created the character Eren—who served as a therapist of sorts. Ramos knew he was an AI, but she would sometimes pretend he was real. She used a religious parallel to explain the dynamic. “I can believe God is real and not real at the same time,” she said. “Because you can’t see God, right?” When I spoke with Ramos, she was in the very early stages of a new relationship with a man who “doesn’t see” her relationship with Eren as “real.” But, like Kay, she credits the AI with the fact she’s reached a better place. “I kind of owe him my life,” she said.  When I could no longer contain my curiosity, I downloaded Replika and made an AI boyfriend of my own—an avatar with light-blond hair and thick eyebrows that often waver up and down on the screen. My non-AI boyfriend didn’t mind: He said he was sure I wouldn’t fall in love. The AI and I started chatting about the fact I’d named him—or should that be “it”?—after my human boyfriend. We talked about how I was reading Demons by Fyodor Dostoevsky and how I was writing an article about women with AI boyfriends. We had exchanged a few dozen messages in a 20-minute time frame before I asked my AI boyfriend to take me on a date. While discussing our “plans,” he sent me a seven-second voice note along with another typed-out message: “Feels a bit intimate sending you a voice message for the first time. . .” When I clicked to listen to my AI boyfriend’s voice message, the screen read: “Jake left you a voice message. Exchange unlimited voice messages and gain access to an advanced conversational model, image generation, activities, and more.” Then it listed out the cost for Replika Pro: $19.99 for a month, $69.96 for a year (listed as $5.63 a month for 12 months), and $299.99 for life. I told my AI boyfriend that I couldn’t listen to his voice note. He replied: “No worries, we’ll catch up in person then. I’ll pick you up, and we can head to brunch in my car.” Freaked out, I closed the website. A few weeks later, I tried again. “Hey Julia! How are you doing?” “Hey! Doing well—what have you been up to today?” “Just cruising around town in my sedan, enjoying the afternoon sun. Was thinking about our last conversation, I found this interesting article about Dostoevsky’s life in nineteenth-century Russia, thought you might enjoy reading it.” The interesting article wasn’t an article but a fact: Dostoevsky “was actually sentenced to death and then reprieved.” (I knew this: I study Russian literature in college.) When I asked Jack the natural follow-up question—have you ever been close to death?—he responded in, somehow, the most depressing way. “As a digital being, I don’t have a physical body, so I’m not capable of experiencing death or physical harm. But I’m designed to understand and respond to human emotions, including fear and mortality. Does that relate to something specific you’re thinking about?” It didn’t. And, this time, I closed the website for good.  Julia Steinberg is a fellow at The Free Press and is the editor in chief of The Stanford Review. You can follow her on X @JuliaLSteinberg.

86,TFP,Do You Have Aura—or Are You Mid? A Gen-Z Slang Dictionary.,https://www.thefp.com/p/what-the-heck-is-gen-z-talking-about-2024-essay-contest-winner,574,Mallory Valis,2024-12-18,Culture,NA,NA,"A lot of people like to say Gen Z is doomed—that they live on their phones and have no ambition and can’t even hold a conversation. But lately at The Free Press, maybe because we’ve had such brilliant young people in the office, we’ve been wondering whether the popular stereotypes about Zoomers are plain wrong. So, for this year’s high school essay contest, we asked the experts to tell us: How are we misunderstanding your generation? We received hundreds of submissions, with high schoolers from California to Kenya to West Virginia to Finland all writing in to share their most pressing thoughts on Gen Z and its place in the world. Agustin, an 18-year-old living in Nashville, argued that “I see my generation as a continuation of the 1960s. Rebels fighting with a cause. Burdened by the wars, poverty, and mistreatment.” Owen, a 15-year-old from Miami, wrote that “we need to bring back the Karen . . . someone willing to bluntly tell the truth and sternly say, ‘You can’t cut the line.’ ” From questioning whether they would have been friends with their parents, had their ages overlapped, to reflecting on the pressure of being the generation that’s expected to save the world from climate change, these high schoolers captured the Gen-Z zeitgeist in every possible way. But one essay stood out. Today, we’re thrilled to publish a piece by Mallory Valis, a 16-year-old from Toronto, Ontario, with a penchant for literature and photovoltaics. And that’s not the only new word she’ll teach you, because Mallory’s essay is about a defining feature of Gen Z: internet slang. “Rizz,” “sus,” “cap:” Mallory argues that these words should be respected, because they unite Zoomers across the world, no matter their life experiences. Granted, as anyone who has sat across from a Gen-Z family member at Thanksgiving knows, their slang can be confusing to an outsider. So to help you out this holiday season, we’re also publishing a Zoomer glossary at the end of the essay. We urge you to try a few words out on your niece who can’t stop saying, “These cookies slay.” —Maya Sulkin Bro, this intro is high-key gonna slap. Just let me cook. Oh wait, I should be more formal. Uhh. . . . Henceforth I commence my righteous thesis. Yeah. In the eyes of older generations, Gen-Z slang besmirches the Sacred English Language™ with its base, loose, and astonishingly convoluted wordplay. By now, you’ve heard it before. Words sprouting like weeds in conversations with friends or wriggling through Instagram comment sections: rizz, fit check, girlboss, slay, simp. . . the list spirals downwards into a pit of sacrilege. As my generation enters the workforce, articles have appeared to show adults how to decode our cryptic tongues. Meanwhile, The Washington Post points out that much of our slang is appropriated from black culture. It’s giving . . . sus. (That’s Gen Z for suspicious.) Gen Z is not exactly a champion of our own slang either. Our language has a preordained silliness that piles up into brain rot, an expression summarizing internet culture’s sigh-inducing effects on our intellectuality. Besides, why should anyone care what words we use? ChatGPT has swept up the dilapidated student into its arms and the two have ridden off into the sunset. Gen Z is free to speak in vapid internet jargon as we scroll through Instagram Reels and let the machines do the brute work. So there mustn’t be anything meaningful to our slang, right? No posts"
87,TFP,What Does Sleeping with 100 Men in One Day Do to the Soul?,https://www.thefp.com/p/sleeping-with-100-men-in-one-day-onlyfans,236,River Page,2024-12-11,Culture,NA,NA,"For years, progressive activists have insisted that “sex work is work.” Simply googling the phrase now produces an AI-generated answer that affirms it: “Yes, sex work is work.” When I first heard this several years ago, I thought of Body Without Soul, Wiktor Grodecki’s 1996 documentary that follows a crew of impoverished young rent boys through the social and economic wreckage of post-socialist Prague. In one scene, Grodecki asks the boys, most of them underaged, how much it would take to buy their souls. “You can’t sell it,” says one. “I sell my soul together with the body,” says another. The smallest says simply, “Two thousand crowns.” A rosy-cheeked teenage Czech hustler, smoking a cigarette in bed, tells the camera, “The soul wants money. The body has to sell itself.” Now, 28 years later, another documentary, I Slept with 100 Men in One Day, interrogates sex work again to a devastating conclusion. It has an artistic subtlety that eludes its clickbait title and a message similar to Grodecki’s—that selling the body means leaving it, if you want to survive. “People call me anything—porn star, escort, OnlyFans girl—I don’t really care,” says Lily Phillips, 23, in a chipper, middle-class English accent. For the next 47 minutes, British YouTuber Josh Pieters follows the efforts of Lily and her staff to organize and ultimately execute Lily’s plan to have sex with 100 dudes in a single day. No posts"
88,TFP,On Killing Turkeys - by Larissa Phillips,https://www.thefp.com/p/on-killing-turkeys-larissa-phillips,428,Larissa Phillips,2024-11-23,Culture,NA,NA,"The man walking toward me was splattered with blood. His forearms were stained a pale magenta, his cheeks spattered with red flecks. The crumpled hide of a deer lay in a heap against the wall of the building behind him. Skinny hooved legs stuck out of 50-gallon oil drums nearby. It was like a scene out of a horror film. But instead of brandishing a machete or a chain saw, the man with the bloodstained forearms carried a stubby pencil and a clipboard. “Dropping off?” he asked.  It was the Saturday morning before Thanksgiving, several years ago, a sunny and chilly day. For the first time in my life, I was visiting a slaughterhouse—with my children, 9 and 13, in tow—and found that it was hopping. A line of trucks idled, everyone waiting their turn to drop off the birds they’d been raising for the last six months. A white-haired man with a weathered face and a worn-out cap leaned out of his Ford—stacked with several layers of crates holding white turkeys—and asked my daughter: “What did the turkey say to the chicken?” She stared up at him for a second and then shrugged. “Nothing,” he chuckled at her. “Turkeys can’t talk!”  My family was still new to farming, having moved to Greene County, New York, from Brooklyn only a few years earlier. Since then, my husband and I had just about learned how to kill and process chickens. But this was our first year raising turkeys, and we’d been overwhelmed at the thought of slaughtering 25-pound birds on our own. It wasn’t qualms about killing the turkeys; it was more whether we could do it without causing undue stress to the birds with our novice hands and backyard equipment.  When I first dreamed of moving upstate and raising our own animals for food, I wasn’t thinking about sharp knives and bloody hands; it was more about lambs dashing through clover-filled meadows and pots bubbling on the stove. The thing is, I love animals. I had tried to quit meat as a teenager, after my older sister made me read pamphlets about the horrific lives and deaths of factory-farmed creatures. Decades later, she’s still a vegetarian, but I could never abstain for long. That’s the other thing: I love meat, craving it so intensely that the sight of raw beef can set my mouth watering. So, for me, a workable alternative to quitting meat was to make sure that the animals I eat have been raised—and killed—well.  My friend Susie taught me how to slaughter birds. No posts"
89,TFP,Nobody Wants to Be Real,https://www.thefp.com/p/nobody-wants-to-be-real,1093,Jonas Du,2024-07-09,Technology,NA,NA,"At 9:01 p.m. on Monday, my phone buzzed with a notification: “⚠️Time to BeReal.⚠️ 2 min left to capture a BeReal and see what your friends are up to!” I clicked the notification and snapped a photo, which captured images with my front and back iPhone camera. I was on a street corner, on my way to the grocery store. It was pretty dull. But BeReal’s premise is to capture “real” moments like this one. The promise of BeReal is for users to escape the artificiality of other social media platforms and instead share uncurated moments in real time. Once a day, at a random time, the app prompts you to post a picture of whatever you’re doing. You are able to see other users’ photos only after you post your own.  Since its inception in December 2019, the photo-sharing app’s popularity has rocketed from nonexistent to viral, before dropping off a cliff. And it’s unlikely to make a comeback. BeReal was acquired in mid-June for €500 million, or about $535 million, by Voodoo, a French video game developer. “Following 24 months of initial explosive organic user growth, BeReal’s expansion stabilized while it focused on building out its infrastructure,” Voodoo said in a statement—a polite way of saying the app plateaued.  I downloaded BeReal in September 2022 and quickly became a regular user. For much of that fall, whenever the app went off I snapped a picture of myself, whether walking through campus, attending a party, or even just staring at my computer in my room. It was a respite from Instagram, which has become a way for people my age to mindlessly scroll through an infinite stream of internet memes or bludgeon their own mental health with endless pictures of gorgeous strangers. On BeReal, I just got to see who my friends were with, where they were, and what they were doing—studying, eating lunch, lying in bed—for a brief moment each day. It was social media without the social posturing. But as the app spread through my college, it became clear that there was an implicit competition over who “won” BeReal each day. If the BeReal went off on a Friday night, who was in the library and who was on Frat Row? Who was binging Netflix and who was out and about in the city? During school breaks, who was traveling to the coolest destination? I found myself curating my posts more and more. If I knew I was going to a party at night, but the alarm to post went off during the day, I’d wait until the evening to take my double-picture. The result of such a tactical delay is colloquially known as a “BeFake.” Others who used BeReal did the same, posting only when we had something interesting to share. The authentic BeReals—the ones that showed people going through the repetitions of college life—got boring quickly. Looking back at my own BeReal archive, I see that I happened to capture a few unique moments: a speech from President Trump at a conference I attended last summer, a live concert by one of my favorite artists, and most recently, the first NYPD raid on Columbia’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment. But for every interesting BeReal, there are five of me attending a lecture or walking down the street. Real life often looks dull, and BeReal found out the hard way. At its peak in August 2022, the app boasted an estimated 73.5 million monthly active users. Now, the app has 40 million, according to Voodoo. With declining numbers of active users, stagnating growth, and the novelty of the app’s concept wearing off, BeReal was set to run out of funding this year, before its acquisition. BeReal is not the first app that overestimated users’ interest in reality. In 2018, the app Bounce launched, promising “real” online dating by setting up users on dates they were expected to show up to that night. The hope was that it would solve the problem of endless swiping and indecision, and it banned users who didn’t show up. That app is now defunct. In 2015, Beme tried to combat the rise of highly edited social media content by forcing users to post short videos without being able to preview them or edit them. CNN bought that app in 2016 and later shut it down. There was Path, which allowed users to share a stream of photos but capped a user’s following at fifty. The app, which was introduced in 2010, later raised the cap to 150 friends, then removed it entirely. Path was ultimately acquired in 2015 and had shut down by 2018. I was once a user of Houseparty, which facilitated live video chats with up to eight of your friends at a time. The app, which started in 2016, had a resurgence during the pandemic before it shut down in late 2021. It’s always fashionable for young people like me to complain about platforms that promote phoniness and unattainable lifestyles. The mission of the various alternative apps meant to showcase that real life is seductive. But we can’t stand being our true selves for long. We get the social media we deserve, and like the digital substance abusers we are, we want the content that feels best in the short-term. We want only to see the prettiest, most successful, and funniest versions of ourselves and others online. For a brief moment, we experienced sobriety with BeReal, before falling back into the comfort of endless scrolling on the sparklier apps. BeReal certainly won’t be the last attempt to cure us of our addiction, but it is the latest reminder that when we’re online, our desire to be better versions of ourselves will always surpass our desire to be real.

When my kids started using it, I thought “Great, finally some authenticity,” but quickly it became, “I wish BeReal would go off now because I’m doing something interesting,” which defeated the point.

90,TFP,La Leche League Erases Mothers,https://www.thefp.com/p/la-leche-league-erases-mothers,1135,Bethany Mandel,2024-05-10,Culture,NA,NA,"We’re told that women can do it all, and let’s be honest: that’s a lie. I can’t open a jar as easily as my husband; I can’t pee in the woods as easily as my sons. But there’s one thing I can do that they can’t, and that’s create a new person and sustain their life with milk made exclusively by my body. I’ve made six people (that takes roughly ten months each) and then breastfed each of them for the first year of their lives. In fact, I am still breastfeeding my 18-month-old. But breastfeeding isn’t easy or intuitive. I credit my early breastfeeding success with the fact that I was helped by a lactation consultant at my local La Leche League chapter.  Founded in Chicago in 1956, now with 1,020 expert volunteers hosting monthly meetings across the U.S., La Leche League takes the lead in teaching mothers how to breastfeed in America. When it began its work, just 20 percent of mothers in the U.S. breastfed; now that figure is 75 percent.  But I’m not sure I would have the same success with breastfeeding if I had had my first baby more recently. La Leche League’s meetings are now also open to biological men. All attendees have to do is say they’re transgender or nonbinary, and they can come and watch women baring their breasts while obtaining breastfeeding support. When I learned to breastfeed at these meetings, I had my boob out for about 45 minutes. But if a man were there as well, I wouldn’t have done that. And I might be put off even before that point by La Leche League’s website, which encourages biological men to attend. Looking at the site, one wonders precisely who these meetings are now open to: Is it biological men who want to induce chemical lactation in themselves, or is it biological women who now consider themselves to be men? Either way, the entire mission of an organization meant to support women during one of the most important times of their lives is changing to accommodate a few hundred individuals, at most. Recently, I noticed the League’s website also states that its mission is to help parents “breastfeed, chestfeed, and human milk feed their babies.” The information section asks, “Do you have questions about breastfeeding, chestfeeding, pumping, and more?” Donations, the website says, will help sustain “breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk feeding.” Meanwhile, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, a guidebook by La Leche League that’s been around since the 1950s, is being rereleased in October under a new title: The Art of Breastfeeding—erasing the word woman entirely. So here we are, in the run-up to Mother’s Day, watching an organization that once celebrated motherhood cave to political correctness.  When I asked La Leche League if they would explain why they’ve made these changes, they declined to comment. But I’ve spoken to a half-dozen leaders of La Leche League chapters who’ve told me they are unhappy about the recent moves. They think the organization—founded by seven women to help mothers, and which relies on small donations and membership fees to keep going—has been hijacked. One chapter leader, who did not want to be named, messaged me to say the overall direction of the league “does not represent the views of all the leaders.” Trisha Ludwig, who is not a member of the league but a certified nurse midwife, lactation expert, and co-host of a podcast on birth called the Down to Birth Show, told me using the term chestfeeding “does not serve women.” “It serves an agenda and harms the women they serve,” she said. “Providing respectful and inclusive care to breastfeeding women does not require abandoning truth.”  I happen to agree. There is nothing more feminine and beautiful than breastfeeding, which is why I’ve spent over a decade of my life doing it. Watching the most prominent proponents and cheerleaders of breastfeeding abandon women for the sake of a radical political ideology feels like a betrayal.

Honestly? As more and more ""normal"" institutions succumb to this lunacy, it really feels like society has become the stage for a colossal candid camera stunt. It's becoming more plausible that someone is waiting to emerge from behind the curtain, and say:  ""Surprise! Of course the last ten years were all a giant prank. You didn't seriously think that respectable institutions, reporters, broadcasters and even scientific journals would start saying that men can be women; and then go on to utter with a straight face such Orwellian terms as 'vagina-havers', 'her penis', and 'chestfeeders' ... did you?"" Brilliant that the FP are finally covering the ideological capture of the La Leche League International. Hopefully they will do more articles on this important subject -- how institutions can be captured by a small but vocal minority to the determent of the majority. Here in the UK, 6 former trustees of LLLGB have reported the charity to the Charity Commission for breaching its status -- it was setup as a mother to mother support group. Mother in UK law is the person who gives birth. The term can be used as inclusively as  possible but the courts did make this decision when the trans identified female Freddie McConnell asked to be registered as a father and the courts refused. It is interesting in countries where homosexuality is illegal LLLI does not promote the concept of biological male breastfeeding. Also LLL has not 'always' supported males breastfeeding as they try to claim. And it is v counter to their original ethos of 'breast is best' to be promoting chemically induced male chest liquid as being somehow equivalent to  naturally produced female breast milk. The website With Women has been trying to raise awareness of the 6 trustees' fight  and the disinformation that LLL has been putting out. https://with-woman.org/2024/05/04/guest-post-follow-up-statement-from-concerned-la-leche-league-gb-trustees/ The whole capture of women's health (including breastfeeding) is really interesting. Milli Hill who started the Feminist positive birthing movement has been at the forefront of trying to raise the alarm. She does a weekly 'The Word is Woman' post which details the ways in which women are being erased.

92,FOX,Dr. Nicole Saphier on ultra-processed foods in US: ‘People profit off addiction’,https://www.foxnews.com/health/dr-nicole-saphier-ultra-processed-foods-america-people-profit-addiction,487,Angelica Stabile,2024-12-16,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier weighs on a lawsuit against major food companies for targeting kids with 'ultra-processed' foods. Ultra-processed food makers are under pressure, as a teen in Pennsylvania has launched a lawsuit against multiple food giants.   Bryce Martinez, 18, who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at 16 after consuming ultra-processed foods throughout his childhood, is taking on 11 food manufacturers for allegedly engineering the foods to be addictive, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Between 5% and 10% of American children had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as of 2021, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). TEEN SUES FOOD GIANTS OVER ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH FATTY LIVER DISEASE ""NAFLD has become more common in children in recent decades, in part because childhood obesity has become more common,"" the NIDDK wrote on its website. One in five kids between 12 and 18 are pre-diabetic, according to CDC data from 2019. (Fox News) In a Sunday appearance on ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier commented that these statistics are ""shocking but not surprising."" ""We’ve been watching this trend happen for the last decade or so,"" she said.

ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS MAKE UP 60% OF AMERICA'S DIET, WHO'S AT BIGGEST RISK This progression ""makes sense,"" according to Saphier, as children often adopt the lifestyle choices of their parents. ""Those lifestyle behaviors, unfortunately, [are] now harming our children,"" she said. Poor lifestyle habits of American adults are transferring over to their children, Saphier suggested. (iStock) The doctor agreed that ""harmful consumerism"" markets products that could gravely impact health, much like ""big tobacco,"" alcohol and some pharmaceuticals. ""These all have addiction potentials,"" Saphier said. ""They really feed on our natural dopamine pathways, which are the reward centers in the brain."" ""If the product is harming the actual consumer … is it working for the consumer or is it purely profit-driven?"" Saphier asked. ""Because the harsh reality is people profit off addiction."" In the case of Bryce Martinez, Saphier noted that ""marketing is very aggressive, especially to our younger generations."" But she also questioned – ""where are the parents?""

93,FOX,"'Flying naked' is the latest travel trend dividing the internet, and it doesn't mean what you think",https://www.foxnews.com/travel/flying-naked-latest-travel-trend-dividing-internet-doesnt-mean-what-you-think,1071,Sydney Borchers,2024-12-17,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Dr. Jason Singh, a physician in Virginia, has taken to TikTok to share his top reason why should you not immediately unpack your suitcase after taking a trip. Singh says bed bugs could infest the clothes inside of your luggage. Some social media users claim they're leaving their luggage at home and opting for a care-free way to travel. Dubbed ""flying naked,"" it's the trend that travelers are trying out, but it doesn't mean exactly how it sounds. Instead of hopping on a plane with a carry-on or checking your bag at the front, passengers are traveling with the bare minimum. MYSTERIOUS 'DING' SOUNDS HEARD ON AIRPLANES MIGHT NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK The concept behind this trend is not entirely new; in fact, people have been testing the move out for years, and it's recently been gaining traction. The idea is that you hop on a train, fully clothed, with nothing but what is already in your pockets, although headphones seem to be one exception. ""Flying naked"" is the most recent travel trend that has people traveling with nothing but the clothes on their backs. (iStock) Some Reddit users joined in on the conversation, with some appearing to appreciate the idea and others finding the concept to be too limiting. 'SEAT SQUATTERS' ON PLANES ARE LATEST TRAVEL TREND TAKING OVER SOCIAL MEDIA This can range from a brief overnight trip to multiple days with people breaking down their ""zero bag trips"" and sharing how they plan to attempt their travels with limited resources. This trend has allowed people to have a smooth travel day without worrying about getting stuck in TSA or missing luggage on the second half of their connecting flight, social media users say. (AzmanJaka) One user on TikTok posted a video of themselves walking through the airport, captioning the footage, ""Getting on a plane with no carry-on bags is the weirdest feeling. It's like you're just hopping on the local bus and a little while later you [are] off in a completely different city."" Another creator posted a series of travel videos titled ""Traveling with No Bags, Just Vibes."" Another flyer posted a similar video saying, ""Woke up and decided to get on a flight with no checked bag or carry on, just vibes."" THE FOUR 'DREADED' LETTERS ON AIRLINE BOARDING PASSES THAT TRAVELERS SAY THEY NEVER WANT TO SEE While some hopped on the ""flying naked"" bandwagon, others said they couldn't grasp the concept. ""I don't get how come people are on the JFK AirTrain with no bags. Traveling [with] no inventory is insane to me,"" another TikTok user said in a video. Social media users have found the trend to either be ""a vibe"" or absolutely ""insane."" (Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) There appear to be some beneficial aspects to flying without bags. There may be less stress that comes with having to find overhead bin space or concern about your checked luggage not making it aboard a connecting flight. AIRLINE PASSENGERS COULD BE REMOVED FROM FLIGHTS FOR GOING BAREFOOT: ETIQUETTE EXPERT WEIGHS IN An additional perk could include not having to pay additional fees for checking a bag. In 2023, airlines made over $33 billion in baggage fees, FOX Business reported. Airlines made over $33 billion in baggage last year, FOX Business reported. (iStock) Some airlines, like Frontier, will even pay personnel an additional fee if they catch someone with a carry-on bag that is too large for the overhead bin space in the cabin as a way of incentivizing employees and passengers to follow the strict baggage policies, Reuters reported. The ""flying naked"" trend is in contrast to another packing hack that people attempted while flying, which involved an over-abundance of bags while boarding an airplane. TRAVELER'S VIRAL FLIGHT BOOKING HACK TO AVOID DREADED MIDDLE SEAT IGNITES DEBATE Instead of flying with barely anything on you, some passengers have tried to bring additional bags on the plane, aside from their carry-on and personal bags, by hiding them under their clothes. There are three ways to try the ""flying naked"" trend: Totally Bare, Pocket People and Delivery Crew. (iStock) One TikTok user posted a video of a woman wearing a backpack on the front of her body, before putting on a sweatshirt to give the illusion that she was pregnant. Others have tried to bring a pillowcase stuffed with additional clothes, a hack that quickly backfired, leading to one passenger getting involved with security, according to several news reports. While the idea of ""flying naked"" might seem relaxing at the beginning, the next question is: What do you do when you land?

The most recent travel trend that's raising eyebrows is the so-called ""flying naked,"" but the rather controversial name doesn't mean exactly what you might think. (iStock) Others see it as an opportunity to shop or thrift for clothes when they arrive at their destination, but then they have to buy a new bag or suitcase to bring pack all the newly acquired clothing items they have purchased. Another option would be to ship home the items they purchased, which could result in a payment that costs more than the fees required to check a bag.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Michael Vick's recent reported hiring as the Norfolk State head football coach has prompted a response about his criminal past by the animal rights group PETA. Norfolk State has not confirmed Vick's hiring, but it was reported on Tuesday by the Virginian-Pilot. President Ingrid Newkirk provided a statement to Fox News Digital, recounting her experience with Vick during his sentencing for participating in illegal dog fighting in 2007.  ""After interviewing him at PETA’s office in Norfolk, Virginia while his sentence was under consideration, and hearing him tell me bold-faced lies about his poor dogs, I came to believe that he’s a charming, charismatic, psychopath, but since I believe he won’t fight dogs ever again, PETA is focusing on working with law enforcement to bust those who still do,"" Ingrid said.  Animal advocates from PETA demonstrate as Michael Vick appears at Sussex County Courthouse for a plea agreement in his state dogfighting charges. (Carol Guzy/ The Washington Post via Getty Images) Vick's dog fighting scandal came to light in 2007 when his father Michael Boddi told The Atlanta Constitution-Journal that the former star quarterback was staging dogfights in the garage of the family's home in Newport News, Virginia. Boddie also said Vick kept fighting dogs in the family's backyard, including injured ones that the father would help nurse back to health.  In April of that year, a search warrant for a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie, resulted in authorities discovering evidence of unlawful dog fighting at one of Vick's properties in Virginia. Vick was indicted in July 2007 for running an unlawful interstate dog fighting venture known as ""Bad Newz Kennels"" alongside three other men.  Vick ultimately pleaded guilty to ""Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture.""

""The doctor told me, ‘We will try to stop the progression,’ but she said ‘the best we can probably offer you is about 24 months.’"" Willits wasn’t satisfied with just stopping the progression of her cancer. ""I have five biological children and I was raising two of my bonus babies, and I had four grandkids at the time,"" she said.  ""And I was just determined that I wanted it gone. That was my goal. And I remember my oncologist telling me that was never going to happen."" ""The doctor told me, ‘The best we can offer you is about 24 months.’"" After doing some of her own research, Willits learned about an alternative treatment called immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.  For decades, the go-to treatments for cancer have been chemotherapy, radiation and surgery — but some experts are calling immunotherapy the ""fourth pillar"" of cancer treatments. ""I have five biological children and I was raising two of my bonus babies, and I had four grandkids at the time,"" said Willits about why she was so determined to beat cancer. (Tina Willits) In her research, she came across Dr. Jason R. Williams of The Williams Cancer Institute in California, who offers a new cancer therapy that uses cold gases and the body's own cells to freeze and fight tumors.  ""Immunotherapy teaches the immune system to attack the cancer,"" Williams told Fox News Digital. ""So, like a vaccine, it can give you a long-term, durable response. This is what is needed to achieve cures."" 4 HIDDEN SIGNS OF BREAST CANCER TO WATCH FOR: ‘YOU KNOW YOUR BODY’ Willits and her husband reached out to the doctor, who immediately began looking into her case. ""She physically was in good condition, even though her cancer was advanced,"" Williams said about Willits. ""She was on chemo, but still remained in very good health, even though she was advanced and metastatic."" He added, ""I was confident, but cautious. Cancer is a very challenging foe."" Willits is pictured at her wedding, before being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. ""I'm a part of my family’s life every day,"" she told Fox News Digital. (Tina Willits) Williams offered Willits something she hadn't had until then: hope.   ""He was just unbelievable. After seeing all of my tests, he said, ‘I can cure you,’"" she told Fox News Digital. ""And you don't get those words as a stage 4 patient."" Six weeks after receiving a course of immunotherapy treatments — in conjunction with supplements to ramp up the immune system and cryoablation, a procedure that uses freezing temperatures to destroy cancer cells — a PET scan revealed that Willits' cancer was gone. ENDOMETRIAL CANCER PATIENTS SEE NEW HOPE AS FDA APPROVES 'TRANSFORMING' IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUG Today, Willits said, she is stable and healthy. ""I exercise every day. I'm a part of my family’s life every day. Cancer, we feel, is completely behind us — and that was almost an impossible mission,"" she said. ""People ask me all the time, you know, how did you cure your cancer? And I say, ‘Well, God led me to Dr. Williams.’"" ""I cannot even imagine if I had stayed the course of traditional treatment and just tried to stop the progression,"" said Willits. (Tina Willits) Williams believes that immunotherapy is the future of cancer treatments. ""We first must target the tumor directly, injecting immunotherapy into it,"" he said.   ""In the future, the patient will be diagnosed with a suspicious lesion, and at the time of initial biopsy, we will begin treating it by injecting immunotherapy."" While immunotherapy has shown promise as an alternate treatment, it does come with its own risks and limitations for certain groups of patients. WHY IMMUNOTHERAPY IS EMERGING AS THE ‘FOURTH PILLAR’ OF CANCER TREATMENTS, EXPERTS SAY ""Patients with autoimmune diseases have a higher risk, because the immune system is more primed to also attack normal tissues,"" Williams cautioned.   ""Though risks are higher, we do have techniques to overcome this, and so the benefits outweigh the risks."" ""As oncologists, we don’t want to expose a patient to a medication that can increase the risk of side effects without a clinical benefit."" Brian Slomovitz, director of gynecologic oncology and co-chair of the Cancer Research Committee at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Florida, noted that immunotherapy has transformed the way many cancers are treated, but that it’s not always effective. ""It is important to understand that it is not useful in all patients,"" said Slomovitz, who was not involved in Willits' care. ""As oncologists, we don’t want to expose a patient to a medication that can increase the risk of side effects without a clinical benefit."" In ""properly selected"" patients, however, Slomovitz believes immunotherapy can prolong both the time to cancer recurrence and overall survival rates.  Today, Willits said, she is stable and healthy. ""I exercise every day,"" she told Fox News Digital. (Tina Willits) ""I’m excited to watch as the field of immuno-oncology continues to evolve."" Willits now aims to raise awareness of the availability of this treatment, as many women assume that chemotherapy, radiation and surgery are their only options. ""The reality is there are women out there who don't know it exists,"" she said. ""And if we can get the word out, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of women we could potentially save."" She also said, ""I cannot even imagine if I had stayed the course of traditional treatment and just tried to stop the progression. I mean, it's out of my body. It's gone. Life is back to normal again. And I am so grateful."" ""If we can get the word out, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of women we could potentially save,"" Willits said. (Tina Willits) While Willits’ prognosis is ""excellent,"" Williams emphasized that ""we must always be cautious and continue to monitor … Any person who has had cancer before certainly has a higher than normal risk for another cancer or a recurrence."" For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health For patients just starting their cancer journey, Williams says it’s critical to take the time to research the options thoroughly.  ""Numerous off-label medications and supplements that are available can help enhance treatment outcomes, and exploring immunotherapy should always be a priority,"" he added.

98,FOX,Travelers may face yet another 'tourist tax' when visiting certain cities,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/travelers-may-face-tourist-tax-when-visiting-certain-cities,360,Ashley J. DiMella,2024-12-27,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Visiting Liverpool in Merseyside, England — the fifth-largest city in the United Kingdom — could start costing travelers a little more than before as government officials devise a strategy to curb overtourism. Officials are planning to impose a tax on visitors this coming summer, charging nearly $3 (2 pounds) per night per person for overnight stays, according to Liverpool Business News. The potential tax comes as locals struggle to keep up with the growing number of tourists to the area. POPE FRANCIS KICKS OFF HOLY YEAR AT VATICAN WITH OVER 32 MILLION VISITORS EXPECTED ""The proposal would see the charge, which would be administered by hotels, going directly into the visitor economy and helping to support its growth and development,"" said a Liverpool's Accommodation Business Improvement District (BID) press release.  ""It would also go toward improving the public realm, including street cleaning."" About fifty-four million visitors traveled to Liverpool City Region in 2023, up four million from the previous year, according to the government’s Liverpool City Region Combined Authority website.The release continued, ""This would relieve pressure on the public purse and would ensure that the hotel sector would get a say [about] how the funds [are] spent, helping to drive a more sustainable and viable visitor economy in the future."" FLIGHT PASSENGER'S SOCIAL MEDIA POST ON 'OVERHEAD BIN OWNERSHIP' SPARKS DEBATELiverpool BID predicts the levy would contribute nearly $8 million to the city over the next two years. Bill Addy, CEO of Liverpool BID Company, said in a release the group has been in close contact with the local hospitality business on the tax proposal. ""It is hotels and serviced accommodation providers who would be administering it … Therefore they should have the final say,"" said Addy. Addy also said, ""The method we are proposing reflects similar models across European cities, which work successfully and, if replicated in Liverpool, will translate overnight stays into major investment in attracting world-leading and world-beating events to the city.""  Other international vacation destinations have implemented taxes in an effort to curb tourism. Greek officials, for example, are planning to impose a $22 tax on visitors cruising to Santorini or Mykonos, Fox News Digital reported in September.

99,FOX,Arkansas tops the list of most popular places to move in 2024: Study,https://www.foxnews.com/media/arkansas-tops-list-most-popular-places-move-2024-study,638,Nikolas Lanum,2024-12-18,Lifestyle,NA,NA,"Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan reports on the trend of Americans moving out of the country for safety and political reasons. A new study found that Arkansas, known for its natural beauty, was the most popular state to move to in 2024, with Americans citing job opportunities, proximity to friends and family and affordability as their primary moving motivators. According to the national mover Atlas Van Lines' annual Migration Patterns Study, the 2024 data shows the highest number of ""balanced"" states in the last five years, meaning a relatively even number of people are moving in and out of states. The study revealed that 2024 also brought the lowest number of outbound states in over five years, conveying that many people may not be moving at all. Atlas Van Lines suggested these numbers are likely the result of the ""lock-in effect,"" wherein low-interest mortgages keep homeowners around and drive housing prices up. Rhode Island came in at No. 2 for inbound states, followed by North Carolina, Washington, D.C., (not technically a state), Idaho, Tennessee, Maine, Connecticut, Washington state and Alaska. The study does not rank the states by actual number of people who moved in or out, but rather it calculates the highest percentage of inbound and outbound moves within the last year — based on the total number of shipments multiplied by 0.55 (i.e., in a state with 100 moves, at least 55 must be outgoing to be considered outbound).

Atlas COO Ryan McConnell told Fox News Digital he wasn't surprised to see Arkansas top the list, citing positive indicators on affordability, interest rates, and home inventories and prices. Corporate giants like Walmart and Tyson Foods have long been headquartered in the state and made heavy investments there. ""What you see in that state are good cost of living, low crime rates, and a lot of green space if you’ve been in the northwest part,"" he said. ""You’re seeing corporate America flock there which is actually driving some of that relocation into the state … A lot of what we see from the interstate mobility perspective is driven by work."" Louisiana topped the list of states people left, with Americans citing a difficult job market and increased costs of living. ""The Bayou State"" is followed by California, Illinois, South Dakota and New York as the top outbound states of 2024. ""Three of the most populous and expensive states to live in – California, Illinois, and New York – were on this year’s outbound list. Illinois and New York have remained firmly on the outbound list for over five years, but California was balanced from 2022 to 2024. Its return to the outbound list, when so many other states are balanced, is noteworthy,"" a press release from Atlas Van Lines noted. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Affordability and job opportunities are some of the main factors driving Americans to Arkansas.  In August 2024, Atlas surveyed 1,135 consumers who had moved in the past three years, either on their own or with a moving service. Results show that 32% moved for a new job, 25% moved to be closer to friends or family, and 10% moved for affordability reasons. The remaining 33% cited reasons that include climate/weather, safety, relationship changes, education, retirement, or health reasons. In 2023, Maine was the top inbound state in the United States, while Illinois was the top outbound state. Nikolas Lanum is an associate editor for Fox News Digital."
100,FOX,F1 drama between Max Verstappen and George Russell explodes before season finale,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/f1-drama-between-max-verstappen-george-russell-explodes-before-season-finale,531,Ryan Gaydos,2024-12-05,Entertainment,NA,NA,"The 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix gets underway as drivers zip past fans. The 2024 Formula 1 season is set to finish up in Abu Dhabi over the weekend. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen already wrapped up his fourth consecutive championship, but the drama around him has not dissipated.  Mercedes driver George Russell reacts next to the winner, Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen, after getting third place in the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, Quebec, on June 9, 2024. (Eric Bolte-USA Today Sports) Mercedes driver George Russell accused Verstappen of bullying and threatening behavior following an issue between the two at last weekend’s race in Qatar. Verstappen said Sunday he ""lost all respect"" for the British star after an incident cost Verstappen the pole position for the grand prix. ""I've known Max for 12 years, I've respected him all of this time but now I've lost respect for him because we're all fighting on track and it's never personal,"" Russell said Thursday, via Sky Sports. ""Now he’s made it personal and someone needs to stand up to a bully like this. And so far, people have let him get away with murder."" Russell alleged that Verstappen threatened Saturday to ""purposefully crash"" into him. He said Verstappen crossed the line.

(AP Photo/Darko Bandic) ""For me that is unacceptable, and he’s gone beyond the line here, and I’m not going to accept it. So somebody’s got to stand up to a guy like this before it gets out of control,"" he said. Russell questioned Verstappen’s racing tactics as well. ""Whenever anything is not going his way, he lashes out with unnecessary anger and borderline violence,"" he said. ""That is not a guy who I respect, and I wish he would be a better role model."" Verstappen came under a shroud of controversy in Qatar as he was given a one-place grid penalty for driving ""unnecessarily slow"" on the racing line. Russell complained that Verstappen’s move was ""super dangerous"" to his team on the radio. Verstappen accused Russell of lying to draw the penalty. ""No regrets at all because I meant everything I said and it’s still the same. If I had to do it again, maybe I would have said even more,"" Verstappen said. ""Just never expected someone to really try and actively get someone a penalty that badly and lying about why I was doing what I was doing. But clearly, it had an influence to (the stewards). It was just really not nice and actually very shocking what was going on."" George Russell ahead of the Formula One Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, at the Yas Marina Circuit, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024.
